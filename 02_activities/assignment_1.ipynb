We live in an age of unprecedented oppor- tunity: If you’ve got ambition, drive, and smarts, you can rise to the top of your cho- sen profession—regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes re- sponsibility. Companies today aren’t man- aging their knowledge workers’ careers. Rather, we must each be our own chief ex- ecutive officer. Simply put, it’s up to you to carve out your place in the work world and know when to change course. And it’s up to you to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do all of these things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of yourself. What are your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weaknesses? Equally im- portant, how do you learn and work with others? What are your most deeply held val- ues? And in what type of work environment can you make the greatest contribution? The implication is clear: Only when you op- erate from a combination of your strengths and self-knowledge can you achieve true— and lasting—excellence. To build a life of excellence, begin by asking yourself these questions: “What are my strengths?” To accurately identify your strengths, use feedback analysis . Every time you make a key decision, write down the outcome you ex- pect. Several months later, compare the actual results with your expected results. Look for patterns in what you’re seeing: What results are you skilled at generating? What abilities do you need to enhance in order to get the re- sults you want? What unproductive habits are preventing you from creating the outcomes you desire? In identifying opportunities for im- provement, don’t waste time cultivating skill areas where you have little competence. In- stead, concentrate on—and build on—your strengths. “How do I work?” In what ways do you work best? Do you pro- cess information most effectively by reading it, or by hearing others discuss it? Do you accomplish the most by working with other people, or by working alone? Do you per- form best while making decisions, or while advising others on key matters? Are you in top form when things get stressful, or do you function optimally in a highly predict- able environment? “What are my values?” What are your ethics? What do you see as your most important responsibilities for living a worthy, ethical life? Do your organization’s ethics resonate with your own values? If not, your career will likely be marked by frustration and poor performance. “Where do I belong?” Consider your strengths, preferred work style, and values. Based on these qualities, in what kind of work environment would you fit in best? Find the perfect fit, and you’ll transform yourself from a merely acceptable employee into a star performer. “What can I contribute?” In earlier eras, companies told businesspeople what their contribution should be. Today, you have choices. To decide how you can best en- hance your organization’s performance, first ask what the situation requires. Based on your strengths, work style, and values, how might you make the greatest contribution to your organization’s efforts?

Drucker harvard business review • january 2005 page 2 COPYRIGHT © 2004 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Success in the knowledge economy comes to those who know themselves—their strengths, their values, and how they best perform. We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: If you’ve got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren’t managing their employ- ees’ careers; knowledge workers must, effec- tively, be their own chief executive ofﬁcers. It’s up to you to carve out your place, to know when to change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do those things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of your- self—not only what your strengths and weak- nesses are but also how you learn, how you work with others, what your values are, and where you can make the greatest contribution. Because only when you operate from strengths can you achieve true excellence. History’s great achievers—a Napoléon, a da Vinci, a Mozart—have always managed them- selves. That, in large measure, is what makes them great achievers. But they are rare excep- tions, so unusual both in their talents and their accomplishments as to be considered outside the boundaries of ordinary human ex- istence. Now, most of us, even those of us with modest endowments, will have to learn to manage ourselves. We will have to learn to de- velop ourselves. We will have to place our- selves where we can make the greatest contri- bution. And we will have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do. What Are My Strengths? Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong. More often, people know what they are not good at—and even then more people are wrong than right. And yet, a person can perform only from strength. One cannot build performance on weaknesses, let alone on something one can- not do at all. Throughout history, people had little need to know their strengths. A person was This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 3 born into a position and a line of work: The peasant’s son would also be a peasant; the ar- tisan’s daughter, an artisan’s wife; and so on. But now people have choices. We need to know our strengths in order to know where we belong. The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations. I have been practicing this method for 15 to 20 years now, and every time I do it, I am surprised. The feedback analysis showed me, for instance—and to my great sur- prise—that I have an intuitive understanding of technical people, whether they are engi- neers or accountants or market researchers. It also showed me that I don’t really resonate with generalists. Feedback analysis is by no means new. It was invented sometime in the fourteenth cen- tury by an otherwise totally obscure German theologian and picked up quite independently, some 150 years later, by John Calvin and Igna- tius of Loyola, each of whom incorporated it into the practice of his followers. In fact, the steadfast focus on performance and results that this habit produces explains why the insti- tutions these two men founded, the Calvinist church and the Jesuit order, came to dominate Europe within 30 years. Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie—and this is the most important thing to know. The method will show you what you are doing or failing to do that de- prives you of the full beneﬁts of your strengths. It will show you where you are not particularly competent. And ﬁnally, it will show you where you have no strengths and cannot perform. Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. First and foremost, concen- trate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge—and those can usually be ﬁlled. Mathematicians are born, but everyone can learn trigonometry. Third, discover where your intellectual arro- gance is causing disabling ignorance and over- come it. Far too many people—especially peo- ple with great expertise in one area—are contemptuous of knowledge in other areas or believe that being bright is a substitute for knowledge. First-rate engineers, for instance, tend to take pride in not knowing anything about people. Human beings, they believe, are much too disorderly for the good engineering mind. Human resources professionals, by con- trast, often pride themselves on their igno- rance of elementary accounting or of quantita- tive methods altogether. But taking pride in such ignorance is self-defeating. Go to work on acquiring the skills and knowledge you need to fully realize your strengths. It is equally essential to remedy your bad habits—the things you do or fail to do that in- hibit your effectiveness and performance. Such habits will quickly show up in the feedback. For example, a planner may ﬁnd that his beau- tiful plans fail because he does not follow through on them. Like so many brilliant peo- ple, he believes that ideas move mountains. But bulldozers move mountains; ideas show where the bulldozers should go to work. This planner will have to learn that the work does not stop when the plan is completed. He must ﬁnd people to carry out the plan and explain it to them. He must adapt and change it as he puts it into action. And ﬁnally, he must decide when to stop pushing the plan. At the same time, feedback will also reveal when the problem is a lack of manners. Man- ners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. This is as true for human beings as it is for inanimate objects. Manners—simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and knowing a per- son’s name or asking after her family—enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. Bright people, espe- cially bright young people, often do not un- derstand this. If analysis shows that some- one’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy—that is, a lack of manners. Comparing your expectations with your re- sults also indicates what not to do. We all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becom- ing even mediocre. In those areas a person— Peter F . Drucker is the Marie Rankin Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management (Emeritus) at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, Cali- fornia.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 4 and especially a knowledge worker—should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. One should waste as little effort as possible on im- proving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from in- competence to mediocrity than it takes to im- prove from ﬁrst-rate performance to excel- lence. And yet most people—especially most teachers and most organizations—concen- trate on making incompetent performers into mediocre ones. Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent per- son into a star performer. How Do I Perform? Amazingly few people know how they get things done. Indeed, most of us do not even know that different people work and perform differently. Too many people work in ways that are not their ways, and that almost guarantees nonperformance. For knowledge workers, How do I perform? may be an even more important question than What are my strengths? Like one’s strengths, how one performs is unique. It is a matter of personality. Whether personality be a matter of nature or nurture, it surely is formed long before a person goes to work. And how a person performs is a given, just as what a person is good at or not good at is a given. A person’s way of performing can be slightly modiﬁed, but it is unlikely to be com- pletely changed—and certainly not easily. Just as people achieve results by doing what they are good at, they also achieve results by work- ing in ways that they best perform. A few com- mon personality traits usually determine how a person performs. Am I a reader or a listener? The ﬁrst thing to know is whether you are a reader or a lis- tener. Far too few people even know that there are readers and listeners and that peo- ple are rarely both. Even fewer know which of the two they themselves are. But some ex- amples will show how damaging such igno- rance can be. When Dwight Eisenhower was Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, he was the darling of the press. His press confer- ences were famous for their style—General Eisenhower showed total command of what- ever question he was asked, and he was able to describe a situation and explain a policy in two or three beautifully polished and elegant sen- tences. Ten years later, the same journalists who had been his admirers held President Eisenhower in open contempt. He never ad- dressed the questions, they complained, but rambled on endlessly about something else. And they constantly ridiculed him for butcher- ing the King’s English in incoherent and un- grammatical answers. Eisenhower apparently did not know that he was a reader, not a listener. When he was Supreme Commander in Europe, his aides made sure that every question from the press was presented in writing at least half an hour before a conference was to begin. And then Eisenhower was in total command. When he became president, he succeeded two listeners, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Both men knew themselves to be listeners and both enjoyed free-for-all press conferences. Eisen- hower may have felt that he had to do what his two predecessors had done. As a result, he never even heard the questions journalists asked. And Eisenhower is not even an extreme case of a nonlistener. A few years later, Lyndon Johnson destroyed his presidency, in large measure, by not know- ing that he was a listener. His predecessor, John Kennedy, was a reader who had assem- bled a brilliant group of writers as his assis- tants, making sure that they wrote to him be- fore discussing their memos in person. Johnson kept these people on his staff—and they kept on writing. He never, apparently, understood one word of what they wrote. Yet as a senator, Johnson had been superb; for parliamentari- ans have to be, above all, listeners. Few listeners can be made, or can make themselves, into competent readers—and vice versa. The listener who tries to be a reader will, therefore, suffer the fate of Lyndon Johnson, whereas the reader who tries to be a listener will suffer the fate of Dwight Eisenhower. They will not perform or achieve. How do I learn? The second thing to know about how one performs is to know how one learns. Many ﬁrst-class writers—Winston Churchill is but one example—do poorly in school. They tend to remember their school- ing as pure torture. Yet few of their classmates remember it the same way. They may not have enjoyed the school very much, but the worst they suffered was boredom. The explanation is that writers do not, as a rule, learn by listening and reading. They learn by writing. Because schools do not allow them to learn this way, It takes far more energy to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than to improve from first-rate performance to excellence.

Schools everywhere are organized on the as- sumption that there is only one right way to learn and that it is the same way for everybody. But to be forced to learn the way a school teaches is sheer hell for students who learn dif- ferently. Indeed, there are probably half a dozen different ways to learn. There are people, like Churchill, who learn by writing. Some people learn by taking copi- ous notes. Beethoven, for example, left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks, yet he said he never actually looked at them when he composed. Asked why he kept them, he is re- ported to have replied, “If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it into a sketchbook, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again. ” Some people learn by doing. Others learn by hearing themselves talk. A chief executive I know who converted a small and mediocre family business into the leading company in its industry was one of those people who learn by talking. He was in the habit of calling his entire senior staff into his ofﬁce once a week and then talking at them for two or three hours. He would raise policy issues and argue three different positions on each one. He rarely asked his associates for comments or questions; he simply needed an audience to hear himself talk. That’s how he learned. And although he is a fairly extreme case, learning through talking is by no means an unusual method. Successful trial lawyers learn the same way, as do many medical diag- nosticians (and so do I). Of all the important pieces of self-knowledge, understanding how you learn is the easiest to acquire. When I ask people, “How do you learn?” most of them know the answer. But when I ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?” few answer yes. And yet, acting on this knowl- edge is the key to performance; or rather, not acting on this knowledge condemns one to nonperformance. Am I a reader or a listener? and How do I learn? are the ﬁrst questions to ask. But they are by no means the only ones. To manage yourself effectively, you also have to ask, Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship? Some people work best as subordinates. Gen- eral George Patton, the great American military hero of World War II, is a prime example. Patton was America’s top troop commander. Yet when he was proposed for an independent command, General George Marshall, the U.S. chief of staff—and probably the most successful picker of men in U.S. history—said, “Patton is the best subordinate the American army has ever pro- duced, but he would be the worst commander. ” Some people work best as team members. Others work best alone. Some are exception- ally talented as coaches and mentors; others are simply incompetent as mentors. Another crucial question is, Do I produce re- sults as a decision maker or as an adviser? A great many people perform best as advisers but cannot take the burden and pressure of making the decision. A good many other peo- ple, by contrast, need an adviser to force them- selves to think; then they can make decisions and act on them with speed, self-conﬁdence, and courage. This is a reason, by the way, that the num- ber two person in an organization often fails when promoted to the number one position. The top spot requires a decision maker. Strong decision makers often put somebody they trust into the number two spot as their adviser— and in that position the person is outstanding. But in the number one spot, the same person fails. He or she knows what the decision should be but cannot accept the responsibility of actu- ally making it. Other important questions to ask include, Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environ- ment? Do I work best in a big organization or a small one? Few people work well in all kinds of environments. Again and again, I have seen people who were very successful in large organizations ﬂounder miserably when they moved into smaller ones. And the re- verse is equally true. The conclusion bears repeating: Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to suc- ceed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you can- not perform or will only perform poorly. What Are My Values? To be able to manage yourself, you ﬁnally have to ask, What are my values? This is not a question of ethics. With respect to ethics, the rules are the same for everybody, and the test is a simple one. I call it the “mirror test. ” In the early years of this century, the most Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. Work to improve the way you perform.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 6 highly respected diplomat of all the great pow- ers was the German ambassador in London. He was clearly destined for great things—to become his country’s foreign minister, at least, if not its federal chancellor. Yet in 1906 he abruptly resigned rather than preside over a dinner given by the diplomatic corps for Ed- ward VII. The king was a notorious womanizer and made it clear what kind of dinner he wanted. The ambassador is reported to have said, “I refuse to see a pimp in the mirror in the morning when I shave. ” That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning? What is ethical behavior in one kind of orga- nization or situation is ethical behavior in an- other. But ethics is only part of a value sys- tem—especially of an organization’s value system. To work in an organization whose value sys- tem is unacceptable or incompatible with one’s own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance. Consider the experience of a highly success- ful human resources executive whose com- pany was acquired by a bigger organization. After the acquisition, she was promoted to do the kind of work she did best, which included selecting people for important positions. The executive deeply believed that a company should hire people for such positions from the outside only after exhausting all the inside pos- sibilities. But her new company believed in ﬁrst looking outside “to bring in fresh blood. ” There is something to be said for both ap- proaches—in my experience, the proper one is to do some of both. They are, however, funda- mentally incompatible—not as policies but as values. They bespeak different views of the re- lationship between organizations and people; different views of the responsibility of an orga- nization to its people and their development; and different views of a person’s most impor- tant contribution to an enterprise. After sev- eral years of frustration, the executive quit—at considerable ﬁnancial loss. Her values and the values of the organization simply were not compatible. Similarly, whether a pharmaceutical com- pany tries to obtain results by making constant, small improvements or by achieving occa- sional, highly expensive, and risky “break- throughs” is not primarily an economic ques- tion. The results of either strategy may be pretty much the same. At bottom, there is a conﬂict between a value system that sees the company’s contribution in terms of helping physicians do better what they already do and a value system that is oriented toward making scientiﬁc discoveries. Whether a business should be run for short- term results or with a focus on the long term is likewise a question of values. Financial ana- lysts believe that businesses can be run for both simultaneously. Successful businesspeo- ple know better. To be sure, every company has to produce short-term results. But in any conﬂict between short-term results and long- term growth, each company will determine its own priority. This is not primarily a disagree- ment about economics. It is fundamentally a value conﬂict regarding the function of a busi- ness and the responsibility of management. Value conﬂicts are not limited to business organizations. One of the fastest-growing pas- toral churches in the United States measures success by the number of new parishioners. Its leadership believes that what matters is how many newcomers join the congregation. The Good Lord will then minister to their spiritual needs or at least to the needs of a sufﬁcient percentage. Another pastoral, evan- gelical church believes that what matters is people’s spiritual growth. The church eases out newcomers who join but do not enter into its spiritual life. Again, this is not a matter of numbers. At ﬁrst glance, it appears that the second church grows more slowly. But it retains a far larger proportion of newcomers than the ﬁrst one does. Its growth, in other words, is more solid. This is also not a theological problem, or only secondarily so. It is a problem about values. In a public debate, one pastor argued, “Unless you ﬁrst come to church, you will never ﬁnd the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven. ” “No, ” answered the other. “Until you ﬁrst look for the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven, you don’t belong in church. ” Organizations, like people, have values. To be effective in an organization, a person’s val- ues must be compatible with the organiza- tion’s values. They do not need to be the same, but they must be close enough to coexist. Oth- erwise, the person will not only be frustrated but also will not produce results.

But there is sometimes a conﬂict between a person’s values and his or her strengths. What one does well—even very well and successfully—may not ﬁt with one’s value system. In that case, the work may not appear to be worth devoting one’s life to (or even a substantial portion thereof). If I may, allow me to interject a personal note. Many years ago, I too had to decide be- tween my values and what I was doing success- fully. I was doing very well as a young invest- ment banker in London in the mid-1930s, and the work clearly ﬁt my strengths. Yet I did not see myself making a contribution as an asset manager. People, I realized, were what I val- ued, and I saw no point in being the richest man in the cemetery. I had no money and no other job prospects. Despite the continuing Depression, I quit—and it was the right thing to do. Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test. Where Do I Belong? A small number of people know very early where they belong. Mathematicians, musi- cians, and cooks, for instance, are usually mathematicians, musicians, and cooks by the time they are four or ﬁve years old. Physi- cians usually decide on their careers in their teens, if not earlier. But most people, espe- cially highly gifted people, do not really know where they belong until they are well past their mid-twenties. By that time, how- ever, they should know the answers to the three questions: What are my strengths? How do I perform? and, What are my values? And then they can and should decide where they belong. Or rather, they should be able to decide where they do not belong. The person who has learned that he or she does not perform well in a big organization should have learned to say no to a position in one. The person who has learned that he or she is not a decision maker should have learned to say no to a deci- sion-making assignment. A General Patton (who probably never learned this himself) should have learned to say no to an indepen- dent command. Equally important, knowing the answer to these questions enables a person to say to an opportunity, an offer, or an assignment, “Yes, I will do that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be struc- tured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the kind of results you should ex- pect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am. ” Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for oppor- tunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person—hardworking and compe- tent but otherwise mediocre—into an out- standing performer. What Should I Contribute? Throughout history, the great majority of peo- ple never had to ask the question, What should I contribute? They were told what to contribute, and their tasks were dictated ei- ther by the work itself—as it was for the peas- ant or artisan—or by a master or a mistress— as it was for domestic servants. And until very recently, it was taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they were told. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the new knowledge workers (the so-called organi- zation men) looked to their company’s person- nel department to plan their careers. Then in the late 1960s, no one wanted to be told what to do any longer. Young men and women began to ask, What do I want to do? And what they heard was that the way to con- tribute was to “do your own thing. ” But this so- lution was as wrong as the organization men’s had been. Very few of the people who believed that doing one’s own thing would lead to con- tribution, self-fulﬁllment, and success achieved any of the three. But still, there is no return to the old an- swer of doing what you are told or assigned to do. Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three dis- tinct elements: What does the situation re- quire? Given my strengths, my way of per- forming, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And ﬁnally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference? Consider the experience of a newly ap- pointed hospital administrator. The hospital was big and prestigious, but it had been coasting on its reputation for 30 years. The What one does well— even very well and successfully—may not fit with one’s value system. This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 8 new administrator decided that his contribu- tion should be to establish a standard of ex- cellence in one important area within two years. He chose to focus on the emergency room, which was big, visible, and sloppy. He decided that every patient who came into the ER had to be seen by a qualiﬁed nurse within 60 seconds. Within 12 months, the hospital’s emergency room had become a model for all hospitals in the United States, and within an- other two years, the whole hospital had been transformed. As this example suggests, it is rarely possi- ble—or even particularly fruitful—to look too far ahead. A plan can usually cover no more than 18 months and still be reasonably clear and speciﬁc. So the question in most cases should be, Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half? The answer must bal- ance several things. First, the results should be hard to achieve—they should require “stretching, ” to use the current buzzword. But also, they should be within reach. To aim at results that cannot be achieved—or that can be only under the most unlikely circum- stances—is not being ambitious; it is being foolish. Second, the results should be mean- ingful. They should make a difference. Fi- nally, results should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable. From this will come a course of action: what to do, where and how to start, and what goals and deadlines to set. Responsibility for Relationships Very few people work by themselves and achieve results by themselves—a few great art- ists, a few great scientists, a few great athletes. Most people work with others and are effec- tive with other people. That is true whether they are members of an organization or inde- pendently employed. Managing yourself re- quires taking responsibility for relationships. This has two parts. The ﬁrst is to accept the fact that other peo- ple are as much individuals as you yourself are. They perversely insist on behaving like human beings. This means that they too have their strengths; they too have their ways of getting things done; they too have their values. To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the val- ues of your coworkers. That sounds obvious, but few people pay at- tention to it. Typical is the person who was trained to write reports in his or her ﬁrst as- signment because that boss was a reader. Even if the next boss is a listener, the person goes on writing reports that, invariably, produce no re- sults. Invariably the boss will think the em- ployee is stupid, incompetent, and lazy, and he or she will fail. But that could have been avoided if the employee had only looked at the new boss and analyzed how this boss performs. Bosses are neither a title on the organiza- tion chart nor a “function. ” They are individu- als and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to ﬁnd out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. The same holds true for all your coworkers. Each works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. What matters is whether they perform and what their values are. As for how they perform— each is likely to do it differently. The ﬁrst secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relation- ships are as much based on the people as they are on the work. The second part of relationship responsibil- ity is taking responsibility for communication. Whenever I, or any other consultant, start to work with an organization, the ﬁrst thing I hear about are all the personality conﬂicts. Most of these arise from the fact that people do not know what other people are doing and how they do their work, or what contribution the other people are concentrating on and what results they expect. And the reason they do not know is that they have not asked and therefore have not been told. This failure to ask reﬂects human stupidity less than it reﬂects human history. Until re- cently, it was unnecessary to tell any of these things to anybody. In the medieval city, every- one in a district plied the same trade. In the countryside, everyone in a valley planted the same crop as soon as the frost was out of the ground. Even those few people who did things that were not “common” worked alone, so they did not have to tell anyone what they were doing. Today the great majority of people work The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with so that you can make use of their strengths.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 9 with others who have different tasks and re- sponsibilities. The marketing vice president may have come out of sales and know every- thing about sales, but she knows nothing about the things she has never done—pricing, advertising, packaging, and the like. So the people who do these things must make sure that the marketing vice president understands what they are trying to do, why they are trying to do it, how they are going to do it, and what results to expect. If the marketing vice president does not un- derstand what these high-grade knowledge specialists are doing, it is primarily their fault, not hers. They have not educated her. Con- versely, it is the marketing vice president’s re- sponsibility to make sure that all of her co- workers understand how she looks at marketing: what her goals are, how she works, and what she expects of herself and of each one of them. Even people who understand the impor- tance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufﬁciently with their associates. They are afraid of being thought presumptuous or inquisitive or stu- pid. They are wrong. Whenever someone goes to his or her associates and says, “This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values. This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be ex- pected to deliver, ” the response is always, “This is most helpful. But why didn’t you tell me earlier?” And one gets the same reaction—without exception, in my experience—if one continues by asking, “And what do I need to know about your strengths, how you perform, your values, and your proposed contribution?” In fact, knowledge workers should request this of ev- eryone with whom they work, whether as sub- ordinate, superior, colleague, or team member. And again, whenever this is done, the reaction is always, “Thanks for asking me. But why didn’t you ask me earlier?” Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust. The existence of trust between people does not necessarily mean that they like one another. It means that they under- stand one another. Taking responsibility for re- lationships is therefore an absolute necessity. It is a duty. Whether one is a member of the orga- nization, a consultant to it, a supplier, or a dis- tributor, one owes that responsibility to all one’s coworkers: those whose work one de- pends on as well as those who depend on one’s own work. The Second Half of Your Life When work for most people meant manual la- bor, there was no need to worry about the sec- ond half of your life. You simply kept on doing what you had always done. And if you were lucky enough to survive 40 years of hard work in the mill or on the railroad, you were quite happy to spend the rest of your life doing nothing. Today, however, most work is knowl- edge work, and knowledge workers are not “ﬁnished” after 40 years on the job, they are merely bored. We hear a great deal of talk about the midlife crisis of the executive. It is mostly boredom. At 45, most executives have reached the peak of their business careers, and they know it. After 20 years of doing very much the same kind of work, they are very good at their jobs. But they are not learning or contributing or deriving challenge and satisfaction from the job. And yet they are still likely to face an- other 20 if not 25 years of work. That is why managing oneself increasingly leads one to begin a second career. There are three ways to develop a second ca- reer. The ﬁrst is actually to start one. Often this takes nothing more than moving from one kind of organization to another: the divisional controller in a large corporation, for instance, becomes the controller of a medium-sized hos- pital. But there are also growing numbers of people who move into different lines of work altogether: the business executive or govern- ment ofﬁcial who enters the ministry at 45, for instance; or the midlevel manager who leaves corporate life after 20 years to attend law school and become a small-town attorney. We will see many more second careers un- dertaken by people who have achieved mod- est success in their ﬁrst jobs. Such people have substantial skills, and they know how to work. They need a community—the house is empty with the children gone—and they need income as well. But above all, they need challenge. The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career. Many people who are very successful in their ﬁrst careers stay in the work they have been doing, either on a full-time or part-time or con- This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

But in addition, they create a par- allel job, usually in a nonproﬁt organization, that takes another ten hours of work a week. They might take over the administration of their church, for instance, or the presidency of the local Girl Scouts council. They might run the battered women’s shelter, work as a chil- dren’s librarian for the local public library, sit on the school board, and so on. Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs. These are usually people who have been very successful in their ﬁrst careers. They love their work, but it no longer challenges them. In many cases they keep on doing what they have been doing all along but spend less and less of their time on it. They also start another activ- ity, usually a nonproﬁt. My friend Bob Buford, for example, built a very successful television company that he still runs. But he has also founded and built a successful nonproﬁt orga- nization that works with Protestant churches, and he is building another to teach social en- trepreneurs how to manage their own non- proﬁt ventures while still running their origi- nal businesses. People who manage the second half of their lives may always be a minority. The majority may “retire on the job” and count the years until their actual retirement. But it is this mi- nority, the men and women who see a long working-life expectancy as an opportunity both for themselves and for society, who will become leaders and models. There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin long before you enter it. When it ﬁrst became clear 30 years ago that working-life expectancies were lengthening very fast, many observers (including myself) believed that retired peo- ple would increasingly become volunteers for nonproﬁt institutions. That has not happened. If one does not begin to volunteer before one is 40 or so, one will not volunteer once past 60. Similarly, all the social entrepreneurs I know began to work in their chosen second en- terprise long before they reached their peak in their original business. Consider the example of a successful lawyer, the legal counsel to a large corporation, who has started a venture to establish model schools in his state. He began to do volunteer legal work for the schools when he was around 35. He was elected to the school board at age 40. At age 50, when he had amassed a fortune, he started his own enter- prise to build and to run model schools. He is, however, still working nearly full-time as the lead counsel in the company he helped found as a young lawyer. There is another reason to develop a second major interest, and to develop it early. No one can expect to live very long without experienc- ing a serious setback in his or her life or work. There is the competent engineer who is passed over for promotion at age 45. There is the com- petent college professor who realizes at age 42 that she will never get a professorship at a big university, even though she may be fully quali- ﬁed for it. There are tragedies in one’s family life: the breakup of one’s marriage or the loss of a child. At such times, a second major inter- est—not just a hobby—may make all the dif- ference. The engineer, for example, now knows that he has not been very successful in his job. But in his outside activity—as church trea- surer, for example—he is a success. One’s fam- ily may break up, but in that outside activity there is still a community. In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as “success. ” The overwhelming ma- jority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their “proper station, ” as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility. In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a success. This is clearly an im- possibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success, there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual’s family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a difference, and be somebody. That means ﬁnding a second area—whether in a second career, a parallel career, or a social venture— that offers an opportunity for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success. The challenges of managing oneself may seem obvious, if not elementary. And the an- swers may seem self-evident to the point of ap- pearing naïve. But managing oneself requires new and unprecedented things from the indi- vidual, and especially from the knowledge worker. In effect, managing oneself demands that each knowledge worker think and behave like a chief executive ofﬁcer. Further, the shift from manual workers who do as they are told There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin doing so long before you enter it.

Drucker by T . George Harris Harvard Business Review May–June 1993 Product no. 93302 Drucker explores the importance of self- management in the world of work. Corpora- tions once built to last like the pyramids are now more like tents, he says. Thus individuals need to take responsibility for their own ca- reers. Instead of assuming a traditional career trajectory up the corporate ladder, think in terms of a succession of professional assign- ments or projects. In today’s organizations, competence is mea- sured less in terms of subject matter and more in terms of abilities—for example, em- pathy and stamina under pressure. So it’s up to you to help others understand what you’re able to contribute to the overall project. Drucker also notes that your role as an exec- utive or manager has changed. You no longer manage a workforce; you manage in- dividuals with a variety of skills. Your job, then, is to combine these skills in a variety of configurations to create the best results for your company. How to Play to Your Strengths by Laura Morgan Roberts, Gretchen Spreitzer, Jane Dutton, Robert Quinn, Emily Heaphy, and Brianna Barker Harvard Business Review January 2005 Product no. R0501G Like Drucker, the authors of this article em- phasize the importance of understanding and leveraging your strengths. They present a feedback tool called the Reflective Best Self (RBS) exercise, which offers a feedback expe- rience distinct from performance reviews (that typically focus on problem areas). RBS enables you to tap into talents you may not be aware of and use them to enhance your career potential. To begin the exercise, solicit comments from family, friends, colleagues, and teachers— asking for specific examples of times when your unique strengths generated especially important benefits. Next, search for common themes among the feedback, organizing them in a table to develop a clear picture of your strong suits. Then write a self-portrait: a description of yourself that distills what you’ve learned from your feedback. Finally, redesign your personal job description so you can better shape the positions you choose to play—both now and in the next phase of your career.

We live in an age of unprecedented oppor- tunity: If you’ve got ambition, drive, and smarts, you can rise to the top of your cho- sen profession—regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes re- sponsibility. Companies today aren’t man- aging their knowledge workers’ careers. Rather, we must each be our own chief ex- ecutive officer. Simply put, it’s up to you to carve out your place in the work world and know when to change course. And it’s up to you to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do all of these things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of yourself. What are your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weaknesses? Equally im- portant, how do you learn and work with others? What are your most deeply held val- ues? And in what type of work environment can you make the greatest contribution? The implication is clear: Only when you op- erate from a combination of your strengths and self-knowledge can you achieve true— and lasting—excellence. To build a life of excellence, begin by asking yourself these questions: “What are my strengths?” To accurately identify your strengths, use feedback analysis . Every time you make a key decision, write down the outcome you ex- pect. Several months later, compare the actual results with your expected results. Look for patterns in what you’re seeing: What results are you skilled at generating? What abilities do you need to enhance in order to get the re- sults you want? What unproductive habits are preventing you from creating the outcomes you desire? In identifying opportunities for im- provement, don’t waste time cultivating skill areas where you have little competence. In- stead, concentrate on—and build on—your strengths. “How do I work?” In what ways do you work best? Do you pro- cess information most effectively by reading it, or by hearing others discuss it? Do you accomplish the most by working with other people, or by working alone? Do you per- form best while making decisions, or while advising others on key matters? Are you in top form when things get stressful, or do you function optimally in a highly predict- able environment? “What are my values?” What are your ethics? What do you see as your most important responsibilities for living a worthy, ethical life? Do your organization’s ethics resonate with your own values? If not, your career will likely be marked by frustration and poor performance. “Where do I belong?” Consider your strengths, preferred work style, and values. Based on these qualities, in what kind of work environment would you fit in best? Find the perfect fit, and you’ll transform yourself from a merely acceptable employee into a star performer. “What can I contribute?” In earlier eras, companies told businesspeople what their contribution should be. Today, you have choices. To decide how you can best en- hance your organization’s performance, first ask what the situation requires. Based on your strengths, work style, and values, how might you make the greatest contribution to your organization’s efforts?

Drucker harvard business review • january 2005 page 2 COPYRIGHT © 2004 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Success in the knowledge economy comes to those who know themselves—their strengths, their values, and how they best perform. We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: If you’ve got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren’t managing their employ- ees’ careers; knowledge workers must, effec- tively, be their own chief executive ofﬁcers. It’s up to you to carve out your place, to know when to change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do those things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of your- self—not only what your strengths and weak- nesses are but also how you learn, how you work with others, what your values are, and where you can make the greatest contribution. Because only when you operate from strengths can you achieve true excellence. History’s great achievers—a Napoléon, a da Vinci, a Mozart—have always managed them- selves. That, in large measure, is what makes them great achievers. But they are rare excep- tions, so unusual both in their talents and their accomplishments as to be considered outside the boundaries of ordinary human ex- istence. Now, most of us, even those of us with modest endowments, will have to learn to manage ourselves. We will have to learn to de- velop ourselves. We will have to place our- selves where we can make the greatest contri- bution. And we will have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do. What Are My Strengths? Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong. More often, people know what they are not good at—and even then more people are wrong than right. And yet, a person can perform only from strength. One cannot build performance on weaknesses, let alone on something one can- not do at all. Throughout history, people had little need to know their strengths. A person was This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 3 born into a position and a line of work: The peasant’s son would also be a peasant; the ar- tisan’s daughter, an artisan’s wife; and so on. But now people have choices. We need to know our strengths in order to know where we belong. The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations. I have been practicing this method for 15 to 20 years now, and every time I do it, I am surprised. The feedback analysis showed me, for instance—and to my great sur- prise—that I have an intuitive understanding of technical people, whether they are engi- neers or accountants or market researchers. It also showed me that I don’t really resonate with generalists. Feedback analysis is by no means new. It was invented sometime in the fourteenth cen- tury by an otherwise totally obscure German theologian and picked up quite independently, some 150 years later, by John Calvin and Igna- tius of Loyola, each of whom incorporated it into the practice of his followers. In fact, the steadfast focus on performance and results that this habit produces explains why the insti- tutions these two men founded, the Calvinist church and the Jesuit order, came to dominate Europe within 30 years. Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie—and this is the most important thing to know. The method will show you what you are doing or failing to do that de- prives you of the full beneﬁts of your strengths. It will show you where you are not particularly competent. And ﬁnally, it will show you where you have no strengths and cannot perform. Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. First and foremost, concen- trate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge—and those can usually be ﬁlled. Mathematicians are born, but everyone can learn trigonometry. Third, discover where your intellectual arro- gance is causing disabling ignorance and over- come it. Far too many people—especially peo- ple with great expertise in one area—are contemptuous of knowledge in other areas or believe that being bright is a substitute for knowledge. First-rate engineers, for instance, tend to take pride in not knowing anything about people. Human beings, they believe, are much too disorderly for the good engineering mind. Human resources professionals, by con- trast, often pride themselves on their igno- rance of elementary accounting or of quantita- tive methods altogether. But taking pride in such ignorance is self-defeating. Go to work on acquiring the skills and knowledge you need to fully realize your strengths. It is equally essential to remedy your bad habits—the things you do or fail to do that in- hibit your effectiveness and performance. Such habits will quickly show up in the feedback. For example, a planner may ﬁnd that his beau- tiful plans fail because he does not follow through on them. Like so many brilliant peo- ple, he believes that ideas move mountains. But bulldozers move mountains; ideas show where the bulldozers should go to work. This planner will have to learn that the work does not stop when the plan is completed. He must ﬁnd people to carry out the plan and explain it to them. He must adapt and change it as he puts it into action. And ﬁnally, he must decide when to stop pushing the plan. At the same time, feedback will also reveal when the problem is a lack of manners. Man- ners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. This is as true for human beings as it is for inanimate objects. Manners—simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and knowing a per- son’s name or asking after her family—enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. Bright people, espe- cially bright young people, often do not un- derstand this. If analysis shows that some- one’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy—that is, a lack of manners. Comparing your expectations with your re- sults also indicates what not to do. We all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becom- ing even mediocre. In those areas a person— Peter F . Drucker is the Marie Rankin Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management (Emeritus) at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, Cali- fornia.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 4 and especially a knowledge worker—should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. One should waste as little effort as possible on im- proving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from in- competence to mediocrity than it takes to im- prove from ﬁrst-rate performance to excel- lence. And yet most people—especially most teachers and most organizations—concen- trate on making incompetent performers into mediocre ones. Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent per- son into a star performer. How Do I Perform? Amazingly few people know how they get things done. Indeed, most of us do not even know that different people work and perform differently. Too many people work in ways that are not their ways, and that almost guarantees nonperformance. For knowledge workers, How do I perform? may be an even more important question than What are my strengths? Like one’s strengths, how one performs is unique. It is a matter of personality. Whether personality be a matter of nature or nurture, it surely is formed long before a person goes to work. And how a person performs is a given, just as what a person is good at or not good at is a given. A person’s way of performing can be slightly modiﬁed, but it is unlikely to be com- pletely changed—and certainly not easily. Just as people achieve results by doing what they are good at, they also achieve results by work- ing in ways that they best perform. A few com- mon personality traits usually determine how a person performs. Am I a reader or a listener? The ﬁrst thing to know is whether you are a reader or a lis- tener. Far too few people even know that there are readers and listeners and that peo- ple are rarely both. Even fewer know which of the two they themselves are. But some ex- amples will show how damaging such igno- rance can be. When Dwight Eisenhower was Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, he was the darling of the press. His press confer- ences were famous for their style—General Eisenhower showed total command of what- ever question he was asked, and he was able to describe a situation and explain a policy in two or three beautifully polished and elegant sen- tences. Ten years later, the same journalists who had been his admirers held President Eisenhower in open contempt. He never ad- dressed the questions, they complained, but rambled on endlessly about something else. And they constantly ridiculed him for butcher- ing the King’s English in incoherent and un- grammatical answers. Eisenhower apparently did not know that he was a reader, not a listener. When he was Supreme Commander in Europe, his aides made sure that every question from the press was presented in writing at least half an hour before a conference was to begin. And then Eisenhower was in total command. When he became president, he succeeded two listeners, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Both men knew themselves to be listeners and both enjoyed free-for-all press conferences. Eisen- hower may have felt that he had to do what his two predecessors had done. As a result, he never even heard the questions journalists asked. And Eisenhower is not even an extreme case of a nonlistener. A few years later, Lyndon Johnson destroyed his presidency, in large measure, by not know- ing that he was a listener. His predecessor, John Kennedy, was a reader who had assem- bled a brilliant group of writers as his assis- tants, making sure that they wrote to him be- fore discussing their memos in person. Johnson kept these people on his staff—and they kept on writing. He never, apparently, understood one word of what they wrote. Yet as a senator, Johnson had been superb; for parliamentari- ans have to be, above all, listeners. Few listeners can be made, or can make themselves, into competent readers—and vice versa. The listener who tries to be a reader will, therefore, suffer the fate of Lyndon Johnson, whereas the reader who tries to be a listener will suffer the fate of Dwight Eisenhower. They will not perform or achieve. How do I learn? The second thing to know about how one performs is to know how one learns. Many ﬁrst-class writers—Winston Churchill is but one example—do poorly in school. They tend to remember their school- ing as pure torture. Yet few of their classmates remember it the same way. They may not have enjoyed the school very much, but the worst they suffered was boredom. The explanation is that writers do not, as a rule, learn by listening and reading. They learn by writing. Because schools do not allow them to learn this way, It takes far more energy to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than to improve from first-rate performance to excellence.

Schools everywhere are organized on the as- sumption that there is only one right way to learn and that it is the same way for everybody. But to be forced to learn the way a school teaches is sheer hell for students who learn dif- ferently. Indeed, there are probably half a dozen different ways to learn. There are people, like Churchill, who learn by writing. Some people learn by taking copi- ous notes. Beethoven, for example, left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks, yet he said he never actually looked at them when he composed. Asked why he kept them, he is re- ported to have replied, “If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it into a sketchbook, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again. ” Some people learn by doing. Others learn by hearing themselves talk. A chief executive I know who converted a small and mediocre family business into the leading company in its industry was one of those people who learn by talking. He was in the habit of calling his entire senior staff into his ofﬁce once a week and then talking at them for two or three hours. He would raise policy issues and argue three different positions on each one. He rarely asked his associates for comments or questions; he simply needed an audience to hear himself talk. That’s how he learned. And although he is a fairly extreme case, learning through talking is by no means an unusual method. Successful trial lawyers learn the same way, as do many medical diag- nosticians (and so do I). Of all the important pieces of self-knowledge, understanding how you learn is the easiest to acquire. When I ask people, “How do you learn?” most of them know the answer. But when I ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?” few answer yes. And yet, acting on this knowl- edge is the key to performance; or rather, not acting on this knowledge condemns one to nonperformance. Am I a reader or a listener? and How do I learn? are the ﬁrst questions to ask. But they are by no means the only ones. To manage yourself effectively, you also have to ask, Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship? Some people work best as subordinates. Gen- eral George Patton, the great American military hero of World War II, is a prime example. Patton was America’s top troop commander. Yet when he was proposed for an independent command, General George Marshall, the U.S. chief of staff—and probably the most successful picker of men in U.S. history—said, “Patton is the best subordinate the American army has ever pro- duced, but he would be the worst commander. ” Some people work best as team members. Others work best alone. Some are exception- ally talented as coaches and mentors; others are simply incompetent as mentors. Another crucial question is, Do I produce re- sults as a decision maker or as an adviser? A great many people perform best as advisers but cannot take the burden and pressure of making the decision. A good many other peo- ple, by contrast, need an adviser to force them- selves to think; then they can make decisions and act on them with speed, self-conﬁdence, and courage. This is a reason, by the way, that the num- ber two person in an organization often fails when promoted to the number one position. The top spot requires a decision maker. Strong decision makers often put somebody they trust into the number two spot as their adviser— and in that position the person is outstanding. But in the number one spot, the same person fails. He or she knows what the decision should be but cannot accept the responsibility of actu- ally making it. Other important questions to ask include, Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environ- ment? Do I work best in a big organization or a small one? Few people work well in all kinds of environments. Again and again, I have seen people who were very successful in large organizations ﬂounder miserably when they moved into smaller ones. And the re- verse is equally true. The conclusion bears repeating: Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to suc- ceed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you can- not perform or will only perform poorly. What Are My Values? To be able to manage yourself, you ﬁnally have to ask, What are my values? This is not a question of ethics. With respect to ethics, the rules are the same for everybody, and the test is a simple one. I call it the “mirror test. ” In the early years of this century, the most Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. Work to improve the way you perform.

He was clearly destined for great things—to become his country’s foreign minister, at least, if not its federal chancellor. Yet in 1906 he abruptly resigned rather than preside over a dinner given by the diplomatic corps for Ed- ward VII. The king was a notorious womanizer and made it clear what kind of dinner he wanted. The ambassador is reported to have said, “I refuse to see a pimp in the mirror in the morning when I shave. ” That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning? What is ethical behavior in one kind of orga- nization or situation is ethical behavior in an- other. But ethics is only part of a value sys- tem—especially of an organization’s value system. To work in an organization whose value sys- tem is unacceptable or incompatible with one’s own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance. Consider the experience of a highly success- ful human resources executive whose com- pany was acquired by a bigger organization. After the acquisition, she was promoted to do the kind of work she did best, which included selecting people for important positions. The executive deeply believed that a company should hire people for such positions from the outside only after exhausting all the inside pos- sibilities. But her new company believed in ﬁrst looking outside “to bring in fresh blood. ” There is something to be said for both ap- proaches—in my experience, the proper one is to do some of both. They are, however, funda- mentally incompatible—not as policies but as values. They bespeak different views of the re- lationship between organizations and people; different views of the responsibility of an orga- nization to its people and their development; and different views of a person’s most impor- tant contribution to an enterprise. After sev- eral years of frustration, the executive quit—at considerable ﬁnancial loss. Her values and the values of the organization simply were not compatible. Similarly, whether a pharmaceutical com- pany tries to obtain results by making constant, small improvements or by achieving occa- sional, highly expensive, and risky “break- throughs” is not primarily an economic ques- tion. The results of either strategy may be pretty much the same. At bottom, there is a conﬂict between a value system that sees the company’s contribution in terms of helping physicians do better what they already do and a value system that is oriented toward making scientiﬁc discoveries. Whether a business should be run for short- term results or with a focus on the long term is likewise a question of values. Financial ana- lysts believe that businesses can be run for both simultaneously. Successful businesspeo- ple know better. To be sure, every company has to produce short-term results. But in any conﬂict between short-term results and long- term growth, each company will determine its own priority. This is not primarily a disagree- ment about economics. It is fundamentally a value conﬂict regarding the function of a busi- ness and the responsibility of management. Value conﬂicts are not limited to business organizations. One of the fastest-growing pas- toral churches in the United States measures success by the number of new parishioners. Its leadership believes that what matters is how many newcomers join the congregation. The Good Lord will then minister to their spiritual needs or at least to the needs of a sufﬁcient percentage. Another pastoral, evan- gelical church believes that what matters is people’s spiritual growth. The church eases out newcomers who join but do not enter into its spiritual life. Again, this is not a matter of numbers. At ﬁrst glance, it appears that the second church grows more slowly. But it retains a far larger proportion of newcomers than the ﬁrst one does. Its growth, in other words, is more solid. This is also not a theological problem, or only secondarily so. It is a problem about values. In a public debate, one pastor argued, “Unless you ﬁrst come to church, you will never ﬁnd the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven. ” “No, ” answered the other. “Until you ﬁrst look for the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven, you don’t belong in church. ” Organizations, like people, have values. To be effective in an organization, a person’s val- ues must be compatible with the organiza- tion’s values. They do not need to be the same, but they must be close enough to coexist. Oth- erwise, the person will not only be frustrated but also will not produce results.

But there is sometimes a conﬂict between a person’s values and his or her strengths. What one does well—even very well and successfully—may not ﬁt with one’s value system. In that case, the work may not appear to be worth devoting one’s life to (or even a substantial portion thereof). If I may, allow me to interject a personal note. Many years ago, I too had to decide be- tween my values and what I was doing success- fully. I was doing very well as a young invest- ment banker in London in the mid-1930s, and the work clearly ﬁt my strengths. Yet I did not see myself making a contribution as an asset manager. People, I realized, were what I val- ued, and I saw no point in being the richest man in the cemetery. I had no money and no other job prospects. Despite the continuing Depression, I quit—and it was the right thing to do. Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test. Where Do I Belong? A small number of people know very early where they belong. Mathematicians, musi- cians, and cooks, for instance, are usually mathematicians, musicians, and cooks by the time they are four or ﬁve years old. Physi- cians usually decide on their careers in their teens, if not earlier. But most people, espe- cially highly gifted people, do not really know where they belong until they are well past their mid-twenties. By that time, how- ever, they should know the answers to the three questions: What are my strengths? How do I perform? and, What are my values? And then they can and should decide where they belong. Or rather, they should be able to decide where they do not belong. The person who has learned that he or she does not perform well in a big organization should have learned to say no to a position in one. The person who has learned that he or she is not a decision maker should have learned to say no to a deci- sion-making assignment. A General Patton (who probably never learned this himself) should have learned to say no to an indepen- dent command. Equally important, knowing the answer to these questions enables a person to say to an opportunity, an offer, or an assignment, “Yes, I will do that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be struc- tured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the kind of results you should ex- pect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am. ” Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for oppor- tunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person—hardworking and compe- tent but otherwise mediocre—into an out- standing performer. What Should I Contribute? Throughout history, the great majority of peo- ple never had to ask the question, What should I contribute? They were told what to contribute, and their tasks were dictated ei- ther by the work itself—as it was for the peas- ant or artisan—or by a master or a mistress— as it was for domestic servants. And until very recently, it was taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they were told. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the new knowledge workers (the so-called organi- zation men) looked to their company’s person- nel department to plan their careers. Then in the late 1960s, no one wanted to be told what to do any longer. Young men and women began to ask, What do I want to do? And what they heard was that the way to con- tribute was to “do your own thing. ” But this so- lution was as wrong as the organization men’s had been. Very few of the people who believed that doing one’s own thing would lead to con- tribution, self-fulﬁllment, and success achieved any of the three. But still, there is no return to the old an- swer of doing what you are told or assigned to do. Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three dis- tinct elements: What does the situation re- quire? Given my strengths, my way of per- forming, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And ﬁnally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference? Consider the experience of a newly ap- pointed hospital administrator. The hospital was big and prestigious, but it had been coasting on its reputation for 30 years. The What one does well— even very well and successfully—may not fit with one’s value system. This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 8 new administrator decided that his contribu- tion should be to establish a standard of ex- cellence in one important area within two years. He chose to focus on the emergency room, which was big, visible, and sloppy. He decided that every patient who came into the ER had to be seen by a qualiﬁed nurse within 60 seconds. Within 12 months, the hospital’s emergency room had become a model for all hospitals in the United States, and within an- other two years, the whole hospital had been transformed. As this example suggests, it is rarely possi- ble—or even particularly fruitful—to look too far ahead. A plan can usually cover no more than 18 months and still be reasonably clear and speciﬁc. So the question in most cases should be, Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half? The answer must bal- ance several things. First, the results should be hard to achieve—they should require “stretching, ” to use the current buzzword. But also, they should be within reach. To aim at results that cannot be achieved—or that can be only under the most unlikely circum- stances—is not being ambitious; it is being foolish. Second, the results should be mean- ingful. They should make a difference. Fi- nally, results should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable. From this will come a course of action: what to do, where and how to start, and what goals and deadlines to set. Responsibility for Relationships Very few people work by themselves and achieve results by themselves—a few great art- ists, a few great scientists, a few great athletes. Most people work with others and are effec- tive with other people. That is true whether they are members of an organization or inde- pendently employed. Managing yourself re- quires taking responsibility for relationships. This has two parts. The ﬁrst is to accept the fact that other peo- ple are as much individuals as you yourself are. They perversely insist on behaving like human beings. This means that they too have their strengths; they too have their ways of getting things done; they too have their values. To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the val- ues of your coworkers. That sounds obvious, but few people pay at- tention to it. Typical is the person who was trained to write reports in his or her ﬁrst as- signment because that boss was a reader. Even if the next boss is a listener, the person goes on writing reports that, invariably, produce no re- sults. Invariably the boss will think the em- ployee is stupid, incompetent, and lazy, and he or she will fail. But that could have been avoided if the employee had only looked at the new boss and analyzed how this boss performs. Bosses are neither a title on the organiza- tion chart nor a “function. ” They are individu- als and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to ﬁnd out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. The same holds true for all your coworkers. Each works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. What matters is whether they perform and what their values are. As for how they perform— each is likely to do it differently. The ﬁrst secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relation- ships are as much based on the people as they are on the work. The second part of relationship responsibil- ity is taking responsibility for communication. Whenever I, or any other consultant, start to work with an organization, the ﬁrst thing I hear about are all the personality conﬂicts. Most of these arise from the fact that people do not know what other people are doing and how they do their work, or what contribution the other people are concentrating on and what results they expect. And the reason they do not know is that they have not asked and therefore have not been told. This failure to ask reﬂects human stupidity less than it reﬂects human history. Until re- cently, it was unnecessary to tell any of these things to anybody. In the medieval city, every- one in a district plied the same trade. In the countryside, everyone in a valley planted the same crop as soon as the frost was out of the ground. Even those few people who did things that were not “common” worked alone, so they did not have to tell anyone what they were doing. Today the great majority of people work The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with so that you can make use of their strengths.

The marketing vice president may have come out of sales and know every- thing about sales, but she knows nothing about the things she has never done—pricing, advertising, packaging, and the like. So the people who do these things must make sure that the marketing vice president understands what they are trying to do, why they are trying to do it, how they are going to do it, and what results to expect. If the marketing vice president does not un- derstand what these high-grade knowledge specialists are doing, it is primarily their fault, not hers. They have not educated her. Con- versely, it is the marketing vice president’s re- sponsibility to make sure that all of her co- workers understand how she looks at marketing: what her goals are, how she works, and what she expects of herself and of each one of them. Even people who understand the impor- tance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufﬁciently with their associates. They are afraid of being thought presumptuous or inquisitive or stu- pid. They are wrong. Whenever someone goes to his or her associates and says, “This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values. This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be ex- pected to deliver, ” the response is always, “This is most helpful. But why didn’t you tell me earlier?” And one gets the same reaction—without exception, in my experience—if one continues by asking, “And what do I need to know about your strengths, how you perform, your values, and your proposed contribution?” In fact, knowledge workers should request this of ev- eryone with whom they work, whether as sub- ordinate, superior, colleague, or team member. And again, whenever this is done, the reaction is always, “Thanks for asking me. But why didn’t you ask me earlier?” Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust. The existence of trust between people does not necessarily mean that they like one another. It means that they under- stand one another. Taking responsibility for re- lationships is therefore an absolute necessity. It is a duty. Whether one is a member of the orga- nization, a consultant to it, a supplier, or a dis- tributor, one owes that responsibility to all one’s coworkers: those whose work one de- pends on as well as those who depend on one’s own work. The Second Half of Your Life When work for most people meant manual la- bor, there was no need to worry about the sec- ond half of your life. You simply kept on doing what you had always done. And if you were lucky enough to survive 40 years of hard work in the mill or on the railroad, you were quite happy to spend the rest of your life doing nothing. Today, however, most work is knowl- edge work, and knowledge workers are not “ﬁnished” after 40 years on the job, they are merely bored. We hear a great deal of talk about the midlife crisis of the executive. It is mostly boredom. At 45, most executives have reached the peak of their business careers, and they know it. After 20 years of doing very much the same kind of work, they are very good at their jobs. But they are not learning or contributing or deriving challenge and satisfaction from the job. And yet they are still likely to face an- other 20 if not 25 years of work. That is why managing oneself increasingly leads one to begin a second career. There are three ways to develop a second ca- reer. The ﬁrst is actually to start one. Often this takes nothing more than moving from one kind of organization to another: the divisional controller in a large corporation, for instance, becomes the controller of a medium-sized hos- pital. But there are also growing numbers of people who move into different lines of work altogether: the business executive or govern- ment ofﬁcial who enters the ministry at 45, for instance; or the midlevel manager who leaves corporate life after 20 years to attend law school and become a small-town attorney. We will see many more second careers un- dertaken by people who have achieved mod- est success in their ﬁrst jobs. Such people have substantial skills, and they know how to work. They need a community—the house is empty with the children gone—and they need income as well. But above all, they need challenge. The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career. Many people who are very successful in their ﬁrst careers stay in the work they have been doing, either on a full-time or part-time or con- This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

But in addition, they create a par- allel job, usually in a nonproﬁt organization, that takes another ten hours of work a week. They might take over the administration of their church, for instance, or the presidency of the local Girl Scouts council. They might run the battered women’s shelter, work as a chil- dren’s librarian for the local public library, sit on the school board, and so on. Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs. These are usually people who have been very successful in their ﬁrst careers. They love their work, but it no longer challenges them. In many cases they keep on doing what they have been doing all along but spend less and less of their time on it. They also start another activ- ity, usually a nonproﬁt. My friend Bob Buford, for example, built a very successful television company that he still runs. But he has also founded and built a successful nonproﬁt orga- nization that works with Protestant churches, and he is building another to teach social en- trepreneurs how to manage their own non- proﬁt ventures while still running their origi- nal businesses. People who manage the second half of their lives may always be a minority. The majority may “retire on the job” and count the years until their actual retirement. But it is this mi- nority, the men and women who see a long working-life expectancy as an opportunity both for themselves and for society, who will become leaders and models. There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin long before you enter it. When it ﬁrst became clear 30 years ago that working-life expectancies were lengthening very fast, many observers (including myself) believed that retired peo- ple would increasingly become volunteers for nonproﬁt institutions. That has not happened. If one does not begin to volunteer before one is 40 or so, one will not volunteer once past 60. Similarly, all the social entrepreneurs I know began to work in their chosen second en- terprise long before they reached their peak in their original business. Consider the example of a successful lawyer, the legal counsel to a large corporation, who has started a venture to establish model schools in his state. He began to do volunteer legal work for the schools when he was around 35. He was elected to the school board at age 40. At age 50, when he had amassed a fortune, he started his own enter- prise to build and to run model schools. He is, however, still working nearly full-time as the lead counsel in the company he helped found as a young lawyer. There is another reason to develop a second major interest, and to develop it early. No one can expect to live very long without experienc- ing a serious setback in his or her life or work. There is the competent engineer who is passed over for promotion at age 45. There is the com- petent college professor who realizes at age 42 that she will never get a professorship at a big university, even though she may be fully quali- ﬁed for it. There are tragedies in one’s family life: the breakup of one’s marriage or the loss of a child. At such times, a second major inter- est—not just a hobby—may make all the dif- ference. The engineer, for example, now knows that he has not been very successful in his job. But in his outside activity—as church trea- surer, for example—he is a success. One’s fam- ily may break up, but in that outside activity there is still a community. In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as “success. ” The overwhelming ma- jority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their “proper station, ” as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility. In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a success. This is clearly an im- possibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success, there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual’s family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a difference, and be somebody. That means ﬁnding a second area—whether in a second career, a parallel career, or a social venture— that offers an opportunity for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success. The challenges of managing oneself may seem obvious, if not elementary. And the an- swers may seem self-evident to the point of ap- pearing naïve. But managing oneself requires new and unprecedented things from the indi- vidual, and especially from the knowledge worker. In effect, managing oneself demands that each knowledge worker think and behave like a chief executive ofﬁcer. Further, the shift from manual workers who do as they are told There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin doing so long before you enter it.

Drucker by T . George Harris Harvard Business Review May–June 1993 Product no. 93302 Drucker explores the importance of self- management in the world of work. Corpora- tions once built to last like the pyramids are now more like tents, he says. Thus individuals need to take responsibility for their own ca- reers. Instead of assuming a traditional career trajectory up the corporate ladder, think in terms of a succession of professional assign- ments or projects. In today’s organizations, competence is mea- sured less in terms of subject matter and more in terms of abilities—for example, em- pathy and stamina under pressure. So it’s up to you to help others understand what you’re able to contribute to the overall project. Drucker also notes that your role as an exec- utive or manager has changed. You no longer manage a workforce; you manage in- dividuals with a variety of skills. Your job, then, is to combine these skills in a variety of configurations to create the best results for your company. How to Play to Your Strengths by Laura Morgan Roberts, Gretchen Spreitzer, Jane Dutton, Robert Quinn, Emily Heaphy, and Brianna Barker Harvard Business Review January 2005 Product no. R0501G Like Drucker, the authors of this article em- phasize the importance of understanding and leveraging your strengths. They present a feedback tool called the Reflective Best Self (RBS) exercise, which offers a feedback expe- rience distinct from performance reviews (that typically focus on problem areas). RBS enables you to tap into talents you may not be aware of and use them to enhance your career potential. To begin the exercise, solicit comments from family, friends, colleagues, and teachers— asking for specific examples of times when your unique strengths generated especially important benefits. Next, search for common themes among the feedback, organizing them in a table to develop a clear picture of your strong suits. Then write a self-portrait: a description of yourself that distills what you’ve learned from your feedback. Finally, redesign your personal job description so you can better shape the positions you choose to play—both now and in the next phase of your career.

      "  - actual output: Peter F. Drucker expounds upon the imperative of self-management in the modern knowledge economy, where individuals must act as their own chief executives. He posits that success relies on a deep comprehension of one's strengths, weaknesses, values, and preferred work styles. Drucker introduces feedback analysis as a tool to discover true strengths, urging individuals to concentrate on these areas for peak performance. He emphasizes that knowledge workers must consistently manage their personal development and contribute meaningfully to their organizations, fostering a sense of purpose through understanding and aligning with the values of their work environment.\n",

We live in an age of unprecedented oppor- tunity: If you’ve got ambition, drive, and smarts, you can rise to the top of your cho- sen profession—regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes re- sponsibility. Companies today aren’t man- aging their knowledge workers’ careers. Rather, we must each be our own chief ex- ecutive officer. Simply put, it’s up to you to carve out your place in the work world and know when to change course. And it’s up to you to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do all of these things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of yourself. What are your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weaknesses? Equally im- portant, how do you learn and work with others? What are your most deeply held val- ues? And in what type of work environment can you make the greatest contribution? The implication is clear: Only when you op- erate from a combination of your strengths and self-knowledge can you achieve true— and lasting—excellence. To build a life of excellence, begin by asking yourself these questions: “What are my strengths?” To accurately identify your strengths, use feedback analysis . Every time you make a key decision, write down the outcome you ex- pect. Several months later, compare the actual results with your expected results. Look for patterns in what you’re seeing: What results are you skilled at generating? What abilities do you need to enhance in order to get the re- sults you want? What unproductive habits are preventing you from creating the outcomes you desire? In identifying opportunities for im- provement, don’t waste time cultivating skill areas where you have little competence. In- stead, concentrate on—and build on—your strengths. “How do I work?” In what ways do you work best? Do you pro- cess information most effectively by reading it, or by hearing others discuss it? Do you accomplish the most by working with other people, or by working alone? Do you per- form best while making decisions, or while advising others on key matters? Are you in top form when things get stressful, or do you function optimally in a highly predict- able environment? “What are my values?” What are your ethics? What do you see as your most important responsibilities for living a worthy, ethical life? Do your organization’s ethics resonate with your own values? If not, your career will likely be marked by frustration and poor performance. “Where do I belong?” Consider your strengths, preferred work style, and values. Based on these qualities, in what kind of work environment would you fit in best? Find the perfect fit, and you’ll transform yourself from a merely acceptable employee into a star performer. “What can I contribute?” In earlier eras, companies told businesspeople what their contribution should be. Today, you have choices. To decide how you can best en- hance your organization’s performance, first ask what the situation requires. Based on your strengths, work style, and values, how might you make the greatest contribution to your organization’s efforts?

Drucker harvard business review • january 2005 page 2 COPYRIGHT © 2004 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Success in the knowledge economy comes to those who know themselves—their strengths, their values, and how they best perform. We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: If you’ve got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren’t managing their employ- ees’ careers; knowledge workers must, effec- tively, be their own chief executive ofﬁcers. It’s up to you to carve out your place, to know when to change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do those things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of your- self—not only what your strengths and weak- nesses are but also how you learn, how you work with others, what your values are, and where you can make the greatest contribution. Because only when you operate from strengths can you achieve true excellence. History’s great achievers—a Napoléon, a da Vinci, a Mozart—have always managed them- selves. That, in large measure, is what makes them great achievers. But they are rare excep- tions, so unusual both in their talents and their accomplishments as to be considered outside the boundaries of ordinary human ex- istence. Now, most of us, even those of us with modest endowments, will have to learn to manage ourselves. We will have to learn to de- velop ourselves. We will have to place our- selves where we can make the greatest contri- bution. And we will have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do. What Are My Strengths? Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong. More often, people know what they are not good at—and even then more people are wrong than right. And yet, a person can perform only from strength. One cannot build performance on weaknesses, let alone on something one can- not do at all. Throughout history, people had little need to know their strengths. A person was This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

But now people have choices. We need to know our strengths in order to know where we belong. The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations. I have been practicing this method for 15 to 20 years now, and every time I do it, I am surprised. The feedback analysis showed me, for instance—and to my great sur- prise—that I have an intuitive understanding of technical people, whether they are engi- neers or accountants or market researchers. It also showed me that I don’t really resonate with generalists. Feedback analysis is by no means new. It was invented sometime in the fourteenth cen- tury by an otherwise totally obscure German theologian and picked up quite independently, some 150 years later, by John Calvin and Igna- tius of Loyola, each of whom incorporated it into the practice of his followers. In fact, the steadfast focus on performance and results that this habit produces explains why the insti- tutions these two men founded, the Calvinist church and the Jesuit order, came to dominate Europe within 30 years. Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie—and this is the most important thing to know. The method will show you what you are doing or failing to do that de- prives you of the full beneﬁts of your strengths. It will show you where you are not particularly competent. And ﬁnally, it will show you where you have no strengths and cannot perform. Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. First and foremost, concen- trate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge—and those can usually be ﬁlled. Mathematicians are born, but everyone can learn trigonometry. Third, discover where your intellectual arro- gance is causing disabling ignorance and over- come it. Far too many people—especially peo- ple with great expertise in one area—are contemptuous of knowledge in other areas or believe that being bright is a substitute for knowledge. First-rate engineers, for instance, tend to take pride in not knowing anything about people. Human beings, they believe, are much too disorderly for the good engineering mind. Human resources professionals, by con- trast, often pride themselves on their igno- rance of elementary accounting or of quantita- tive methods altogether. But taking pride in such ignorance is self-defeating. Go to work on acquiring the skills and knowledge you need to fully realize your strengths. It is equally essential to remedy your bad habits—the things you do or fail to do that in- hibit your effectiveness and performance. Such habits will quickly show up in the feedback. For example, a planner may ﬁnd that his beau- tiful plans fail because he does not follow through on them. Like so many brilliant peo- ple, he believes that ideas move mountains. But bulldozers move mountains; ideas show where the bulldozers should go to work. This planner will have to learn that the work does not stop when the plan is completed. He must ﬁnd people to carry out the plan and explain it to them. He must adapt and change it as he puts it into action. And ﬁnally, he must decide when to stop pushing the plan. At the same time, feedback will also reveal when the problem is a lack of manners. Man- ners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. This is as true for human beings as it is for inanimate objects. Manners—simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and knowing a per- son’s name or asking after her family—enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. Bright people, espe- cially bright young people, often do not un- derstand this. If analysis shows that some- one’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy—that is, a lack of manners. Comparing your expectations with your re- sults also indicates what not to do. We all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becom- ing even mediocre. In those areas a person— Peter F . Drucker is the Marie Rankin Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management (Emeritus) at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, Cali- fornia.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 4 and especially a knowledge worker—should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. One should waste as little effort as possible on im- proving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from in- competence to mediocrity than it takes to im- prove from ﬁrst-rate performance to excel- lence. And yet most people—especially most teachers and most organizations—concen- trate on making incompetent performers into mediocre ones. Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent per- son into a star performer. How Do I Perform? Amazingly few people know how they get things done. Indeed, most of us do not even know that different people work and perform differently. Too many people work in ways that are not their ways, and that almost guarantees nonperformance. For knowledge workers, How do I perform? may be an even more important question than What are my strengths? Like one’s strengths, how one performs is unique. It is a matter of personality. Whether personality be a matter of nature or nurture, it surely is formed long before a person goes to work. And how a person performs is a given, just as what a person is good at or not good at is a given. A person’s way of performing can be slightly modiﬁed, but it is unlikely to be com- pletely changed—and certainly not easily. Just as people achieve results by doing what they are good at, they also achieve results by work- ing in ways that they best perform. A few com- mon personality traits usually determine how a person performs. Am I a reader or a listener? The ﬁrst thing to know is whether you are a reader or a lis- tener. Far too few people even know that there are readers and listeners and that peo- ple are rarely both. Even fewer know which of the two they themselves are. But some ex- amples will show how damaging such igno- rance can be. When Dwight Eisenhower was Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, he was the darling of the press. His press confer- ences were famous for their style—General Eisenhower showed total command of what- ever question he was asked, and he was able to describe a situation and explain a policy in two or three beautifully polished and elegant sen- tences. Ten years later, the same journalists who had been his admirers held President Eisenhower in open contempt. He never ad- dressed the questions, they complained, but rambled on endlessly about something else. And they constantly ridiculed him for butcher- ing the King’s English in incoherent and un- grammatical answers. Eisenhower apparently did not know that he was a reader, not a listener. When he was Supreme Commander in Europe, his aides made sure that every question from the press was presented in writing at least half an hour before a conference was to begin. And then Eisenhower was in total command. When he became president, he succeeded two listeners, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Both men knew themselves to be listeners and both enjoyed free-for-all press conferences. Eisen- hower may have felt that he had to do what his two predecessors had done. As a result, he never even heard the questions journalists asked. And Eisenhower is not even an extreme case of a nonlistener. A few years later, Lyndon Johnson destroyed his presidency, in large measure, by not know- ing that he was a listener. His predecessor, John Kennedy, was a reader who had assem- bled a brilliant group of writers as his assis- tants, making sure that they wrote to him be- fore discussing their memos in person. Johnson kept these people on his staff—and they kept on writing. He never, apparently, understood one word of what they wrote. Yet as a senator, Johnson had been superb; for parliamentari- ans have to be, above all, listeners. Few listeners can be made, or can make themselves, into competent readers—and vice versa. The listener who tries to be a reader will, therefore, suffer the fate of Lyndon Johnson, whereas the reader who tries to be a listener will suffer the fate of Dwight Eisenhower. They will not perform or achieve. How do I learn? The second thing to know about how one performs is to know how one learns. Many ﬁrst-class writers—Winston Churchill is but one example—do poorly in school. They tend to remember their school- ing as pure torture. Yet few of their classmates remember it the same way. They may not have enjoyed the school very much, but the worst they suffered was boredom. The explanation is that writers do not, as a rule, learn by listening and reading. They learn by writing. Because schools do not allow them to learn this way, It takes far more energy to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than to improve from first-rate performance to excellence.

Schools everywhere are organized on the as- sumption that there is only one right way to learn and that it is the same way for everybody. But to be forced to learn the way a school teaches is sheer hell for students who learn dif- ferently. Indeed, there are probably half a dozen different ways to learn. There are people, like Churchill, who learn by writing. Some people learn by taking copi- ous notes. Beethoven, for example, left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks, yet he said he never actually looked at them when he composed. Asked why he kept them, he is re- ported to have replied, “If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it into a sketchbook, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again. ” Some people learn by doing. Others learn by hearing themselves talk. A chief executive I know who converted a small and mediocre family business into the leading company in its industry was one of those people who learn by talking. He was in the habit of calling his entire senior staff into his ofﬁce once a week and then talking at them for two or three hours. He would raise policy issues and argue three different positions on each one. He rarely asked his associates for comments or questions; he simply needed an audience to hear himself talk. That’s how he learned. And although he is a fairly extreme case, learning through talking is by no means an unusual method. Successful trial lawyers learn the same way, as do many medical diag- nosticians (and so do I). Of all the important pieces of self-knowledge, understanding how you learn is the easiest to acquire. When I ask people, “How do you learn?” most of them know the answer. But when I ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?” few answer yes. And yet, acting on this knowl- edge is the key to performance; or rather, not acting on this knowledge condemns one to nonperformance. Am I a reader or a listener? and How do I learn? are the ﬁrst questions to ask. But they are by no means the only ones. To manage yourself effectively, you also have to ask, Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship? Some people work best as subordinates. Gen- eral George Patton, the great American military hero of World War II, is a prime example. Patton was America’s top troop commander. Yet when he was proposed for an independent command, General George Marshall, the U.S. chief of staff—and probably the most successful picker of men in U.S. history—said, “Patton is the best subordinate the American army has ever pro- duced, but he would be the worst commander. ” Some people work best as team members. Others work best alone. Some are exception- ally talented as coaches and mentors; others are simply incompetent as mentors. Another crucial question is, Do I produce re- sults as a decision maker or as an adviser? A great many people perform best as advisers but cannot take the burden and pressure of making the decision. A good many other peo- ple, by contrast, need an adviser to force them- selves to think; then they can make decisions and act on them with speed, self-conﬁdence, and courage. This is a reason, by the way, that the num- ber two person in an organization often fails when promoted to the number one position. The top spot requires a decision maker. Strong decision makers often put somebody they trust into the number two spot as their adviser— and in that position the person is outstanding. But in the number one spot, the same person fails. He or she knows what the decision should be but cannot accept the responsibility of actu- ally making it. Other important questions to ask include, Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environ- ment? Do I work best in a big organization or a small one? Few people work well in all kinds of environments. Again and again, I have seen people who were very successful in large organizations ﬂounder miserably when they moved into smaller ones. And the re- verse is equally true. The conclusion bears repeating: Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to suc- ceed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you can- not perform or will only perform poorly. What Are My Values? To be able to manage yourself, you ﬁnally have to ask, What are my values? This is not a question of ethics. With respect to ethics, the rules are the same for everybody, and the test is a simple one. I call it the “mirror test. ” In the early years of this century, the most Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. Work to improve the way you perform.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 6 highly respected diplomat of all the great pow- ers was the German ambassador in London. He was clearly destined for great things—to become his country’s foreign minister, at least, if not its federal chancellor. Yet in 1906 he abruptly resigned rather than preside over a dinner given by the diplomatic corps for Ed- ward VII. The king was a notorious womanizer and made it clear what kind of dinner he wanted. The ambassador is reported to have said, “I refuse to see a pimp in the mirror in the morning when I shave. ” That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning? What is ethical behavior in one kind of orga- nization or situation is ethical behavior in an- other. But ethics is only part of a value sys- tem—especially of an organization’s value system. To work in an organization whose value sys- tem is unacceptable or incompatible with one’s own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance. Consider the experience of a highly success- ful human resources executive whose com- pany was acquired by a bigger organization. After the acquisition, she was promoted to do the kind of work she did best, which included selecting people for important positions. The executive deeply believed that a company should hire people for such positions from the outside only after exhausting all the inside pos- sibilities. But her new company believed in ﬁrst looking outside “to bring in fresh blood. ” There is something to be said for both ap- proaches—in my experience, the proper one is to do some of both. They are, however, funda- mentally incompatible—not as policies but as values. They bespeak different views of the re- lationship between organizations and people; different views of the responsibility of an orga- nization to its people and their development; and different views of a person’s most impor- tant contribution to an enterprise. After sev- eral years of frustration, the executive quit—at considerable ﬁnancial loss. Her values and the values of the organization simply were not compatible. Similarly, whether a pharmaceutical com- pany tries to obtain results by making constant, small improvements or by achieving occa- sional, highly expensive, and risky “break- throughs” is not primarily an economic ques- tion. The results of either strategy may be pretty much the same. At bottom, there is a conﬂict between a value system that sees the company’s contribution in terms of helping physicians do better what they already do and a value system that is oriented toward making scientiﬁc discoveries. Whether a business should be run for short- term results or with a focus on the long term is likewise a question of values. Financial ana- lysts believe that businesses can be run for both simultaneously. Successful businesspeo- ple know better. To be sure, every company has to produce short-term results. But in any conﬂict between short-term results and long- term growth, each company will determine its own priority. This is not primarily a disagree- ment about economics. It is fundamentally a value conﬂict regarding the function of a busi- ness and the responsibility of management. Value conﬂicts are not limited to business organizations. One of the fastest-growing pas- toral churches in the United States measures success by the number of new parishioners. Its leadership believes that what matters is how many newcomers join the congregation. The Good Lord will then minister to their spiritual needs or at least to the needs of a sufﬁcient percentage. Another pastoral, evan- gelical church believes that what matters is people’s spiritual growth. The church eases out newcomers who join but do not enter into its spiritual life. Again, this is not a matter of numbers. At ﬁrst glance, it appears that the second church grows more slowly. But it retains a far larger proportion of newcomers than the ﬁrst one does. Its growth, in other words, is more solid. This is also not a theological problem, or only secondarily so. It is a problem about values. In a public debate, one pastor argued, “Unless you ﬁrst come to church, you will never ﬁnd the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven. ” “No, ” answered the other. “Until you ﬁrst look for the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven, you don’t belong in church. ” Organizations, like people, have values. To be effective in an organization, a person’s val- ues must be compatible with the organiza- tion’s values. They do not need to be the same, but they must be close enough to coexist. Oth- erwise, the person will not only be frustrated but also will not produce results.

But there is sometimes a conﬂict between a person’s values and his or her strengths. What one does well—even very well and successfully—may not ﬁt with one’s value system. In that case, the work may not appear to be worth devoting one’s life to (or even a substantial portion thereof). If I may, allow me to interject a personal note. Many years ago, I too had to decide be- tween my values and what I was doing success- fully. I was doing very well as a young invest- ment banker in London in the mid-1930s, and the work clearly ﬁt my strengths. Yet I did not see myself making a contribution as an asset manager. People, I realized, were what I val- ued, and I saw no point in being the richest man in the cemetery. I had no money and no other job prospects. Despite the continuing Depression, I quit—and it was the right thing to do. Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test. Where Do I Belong? A small number of people know very early where they belong. Mathematicians, musi- cians, and cooks, for instance, are usually mathematicians, musicians, and cooks by the time they are four or ﬁve years old. Physi- cians usually decide on their careers in their teens, if not earlier. But most people, espe- cially highly gifted people, do not really know where they belong until they are well past their mid-twenties. By that time, how- ever, they should know the answers to the three questions: What are my strengths? How do I perform? and, What are my values? And then they can and should decide where they belong. Or rather, they should be able to decide where they do not belong. The person who has learned that he or she does not perform well in a big organization should have learned to say no to a position in one. The person who has learned that he or she is not a decision maker should have learned to say no to a deci- sion-making assignment. A General Patton (who probably never learned this himself) should have learned to say no to an indepen- dent command. Equally important, knowing the answer to these questions enables a person to say to an opportunity, an offer, or an assignment, “Yes, I will do that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be struc- tured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the kind of results you should ex- pect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am. ” Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for oppor- tunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person—hardworking and compe- tent but otherwise mediocre—into an out- standing performer. What Should I Contribute? Throughout history, the great majority of peo- ple never had to ask the question, What should I contribute? They were told what to contribute, and their tasks were dictated ei- ther by the work itself—as it was for the peas- ant or artisan—or by a master or a mistress— as it was for domestic servants. And until very recently, it was taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they were told. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the new knowledge workers (the so-called organi- zation men) looked to their company’s person- nel department to plan their careers. Then in the late 1960s, no one wanted to be told what to do any longer. Young men and women began to ask, What do I want to do? And what they heard was that the way to con- tribute was to “do your own thing. ” But this so- lution was as wrong as the organization men’s had been. Very few of the people who believed that doing one’s own thing would lead to con- tribution, self-fulﬁllment, and success achieved any of the three. But still, there is no return to the old an- swer of doing what you are told or assigned to do. Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three dis- tinct elements: What does the situation re- quire? Given my strengths, my way of per- forming, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And ﬁnally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference? Consider the experience of a newly ap- pointed hospital administrator. The hospital was big and prestigious, but it had been coasting on its reputation for 30 years. The What one does well— even very well and successfully—may not fit with one’s value system. This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 8 new administrator decided that his contribu- tion should be to establish a standard of ex- cellence in one important area within two years. He chose to focus on the emergency room, which was big, visible, and sloppy. He decided that every patient who came into the ER had to be seen by a qualiﬁed nurse within 60 seconds. Within 12 months, the hospital’s emergency room had become a model for all hospitals in the United States, and within an- other two years, the whole hospital had been transformed. As this example suggests, it is rarely possi- ble—or even particularly fruitful—to look too far ahead. A plan can usually cover no more than 18 months and still be reasonably clear and speciﬁc. So the question in most cases should be, Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half? The answer must bal- ance several things. First, the results should be hard to achieve—they should require “stretching, ” to use the current buzzword. But also, they should be within reach. To aim at results that cannot be achieved—or that can be only under the most unlikely circum- stances—is not being ambitious; it is being foolish. Second, the results should be mean- ingful. They should make a difference. Fi- nally, results should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable. From this will come a course of action: what to do, where and how to start, and what goals and deadlines to set. Responsibility for Relationships Very few people work by themselves and achieve results by themselves—a few great art- ists, a few great scientists, a few great athletes. Most people work with others and are effec- tive with other people. That is true whether they are members of an organization or inde- pendently employed. Managing yourself re- quires taking responsibility for relationships. This has two parts. The ﬁrst is to accept the fact that other peo- ple are as much individuals as you yourself are. They perversely insist on behaving like human beings. This means that they too have their strengths; they too have their ways of getting things done; they too have their values. To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the val- ues of your coworkers. That sounds obvious, but few people pay at- tention to it. Typical is the person who was trained to write reports in his or her ﬁrst as- signment because that boss was a reader. Even if the next boss is a listener, the person goes on writing reports that, invariably, produce no re- sults. Invariably the boss will think the em- ployee is stupid, incompetent, and lazy, and he or she will fail. But that could have been avoided if the employee had only looked at the new boss and analyzed how this boss performs. Bosses are neither a title on the organiza- tion chart nor a “function. ” They are individu- als and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to ﬁnd out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. The same holds true for all your coworkers. Each works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. What matters is whether they perform and what their values are. As for how they perform— each is likely to do it differently. The ﬁrst secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relation- ships are as much based on the people as they are on the work. The second part of relationship responsibil- ity is taking responsibility for communication. Whenever I, or any other consultant, start to work with an organization, the ﬁrst thing I hear about are all the personality conﬂicts. Most of these arise from the fact that people do not know what other people are doing and how they do their work, or what contribution the other people are concentrating on and what results they expect. And the reason they do not know is that they have not asked and therefore have not been told. This failure to ask reﬂects human stupidity less than it reﬂects human history. Until re- cently, it was unnecessary to tell any of these things to anybody. In the medieval city, every- one in a district plied the same trade. In the countryside, everyone in a valley planted the same crop as soon as the frost was out of the ground. Even those few people who did things that were not “common” worked alone, so they did not have to tell anyone what they were doing. Today the great majority of people work The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with so that you can make use of their strengths.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 9 with others who have different tasks and re- sponsibilities. The marketing vice president may have come out of sales and know every- thing about sales, but she knows nothing about the things she has never done—pricing, advertising, packaging, and the like. So the people who do these things must make sure that the marketing vice president understands what they are trying to do, why they are trying to do it, how they are going to do it, and what results to expect. If the marketing vice president does not un- derstand what these high-grade knowledge specialists are doing, it is primarily their fault, not hers. They have not educated her. Con- versely, it is the marketing vice president’s re- sponsibility to make sure that all of her co- workers understand how she looks at marketing: what her goals are, how she works, and what she expects of herself and of each one of them. Even people who understand the impor- tance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufﬁciently with their associates. They are afraid of being thought presumptuous or inquisitive or stu- pid. They are wrong. Whenever someone goes to his or her associates and says, “This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values. This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be ex- pected to deliver, ” the response is always, “This is most helpful. But why didn’t you tell me earlier?” And one gets the same reaction—without exception, in my experience—if one continues by asking, “And what do I need to know about your strengths, how you perform, your values, and your proposed contribution?” In fact, knowledge workers should request this of ev- eryone with whom they work, whether as sub- ordinate, superior, colleague, or team member. And again, whenever this is done, the reaction is always, “Thanks for asking me. But why didn’t you ask me earlier?” Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust. The existence of trust between people does not necessarily mean that they like one another. It means that they under- stand one another. Taking responsibility for re- lationships is therefore an absolute necessity. It is a duty. Whether one is a member of the orga- nization, a consultant to it, a supplier, or a dis- tributor, one owes that responsibility to all one’s coworkers: those whose work one de- pends on as well as those who depend on one’s own work. The Second Half of Your Life When work for most people meant manual la- bor, there was no need to worry about the sec- ond half of your life. You simply kept on doing what you had always done. And if you were lucky enough to survive 40 years of hard work in the mill or on the railroad, you were quite happy to spend the rest of your life doing nothing. Today, however, most work is knowl- edge work, and knowledge workers are not “ﬁnished” after 40 years on the job, they are merely bored. We hear a great deal of talk about the midlife crisis of the executive. It is mostly boredom. At 45, most executives have reached the peak of their business careers, and they know it. After 20 years of doing very much the same kind of work, they are very good at their jobs. But they are not learning or contributing or deriving challenge and satisfaction from the job. And yet they are still likely to face an- other 20 if not 25 years of work. That is why managing oneself increasingly leads one to begin a second career. There are three ways to develop a second ca- reer. The ﬁrst is actually to start one. Often this takes nothing more than moving from one kind of organization to another: the divisional controller in a large corporation, for instance, becomes the controller of a medium-sized hos- pital. But there are also growing numbers of people who move into different lines of work altogether: the business executive or govern- ment ofﬁcial who enters the ministry at 45, for instance; or the midlevel manager who leaves corporate life after 20 years to attend law school and become a small-town attorney. We will see many more second careers un- dertaken by people who have achieved mod- est success in their ﬁrst jobs. Such people have substantial skills, and they know how to work. They need a community—the house is empty with the children gone—and they need income as well. But above all, they need challenge. The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career. Many people who are very successful in their ﬁrst careers stay in the work they have been doing, either on a full-time or part-time or con- This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

But in addition, they create a par- allel job, usually in a nonproﬁt organization, that takes another ten hours of work a week. They might take over the administration of their church, for instance, or the presidency of the local Girl Scouts council. They might run the battered women’s shelter, work as a chil- dren’s librarian for the local public library, sit on the school board, and so on. Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs. These are usually people who have been very successful in their ﬁrst careers. They love their work, but it no longer challenges them. In many cases they keep on doing what they have been doing all along but spend less and less of their time on it. They also start another activ- ity, usually a nonproﬁt. My friend Bob Buford, for example, built a very successful television company that he still runs. But he has also founded and built a successful nonproﬁt orga- nization that works with Protestant churches, and he is building another to teach social en- trepreneurs how to manage their own non- proﬁt ventures while still running their origi- nal businesses. People who manage the second half of their lives may always be a minority. The majority may “retire on the job” and count the years until their actual retirement. But it is this mi- nority, the men and women who see a long working-life expectancy as an opportunity both for themselves and for society, who will become leaders and models. There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin long before you enter it. When it ﬁrst became clear 30 years ago that working-life expectancies were lengthening very fast, many observers (including myself) believed that retired peo- ple would increasingly become volunteers for nonproﬁt institutions. That has not happened. If one does not begin to volunteer before one is 40 or so, one will not volunteer once past 60. Similarly, all the social entrepreneurs I know began to work in their chosen second en- terprise long before they reached their peak in their original business. Consider the example of a successful lawyer, the legal counsel to a large corporation, who has started a venture to establish model schools in his state. He began to do volunteer legal work for the schools when he was around 35. He was elected to the school board at age 40. At age 50, when he had amassed a fortune, he started his own enter- prise to build and to run model schools. He is, however, still working nearly full-time as the lead counsel in the company he helped found as a young lawyer. There is another reason to develop a second major interest, and to develop it early. No one can expect to live very long without experienc- ing a serious setback in his or her life or work. There is the competent engineer who is passed over for promotion at age 45. There is the com- petent college professor who realizes at age 42 that she will never get a professorship at a big university, even though she may be fully quali- ﬁed for it. There are tragedies in one’s family life: the breakup of one’s marriage or the loss of a child. At such times, a second major inter- est—not just a hobby—may make all the dif- ference. The engineer, for example, now knows that he has not been very successful in his job. But in his outside activity—as church trea- surer, for example—he is a success. One’s fam- ily may break up, but in that outside activity there is still a community. In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as “success. ” The overwhelming ma- jority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their “proper station, ” as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility. In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a success. This is clearly an im- possibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success, there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual’s family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a difference, and be somebody. That means ﬁnding a second area—whether in a second career, a parallel career, or a social venture— that offers an opportunity for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success. The challenges of managing oneself may seem obvious, if not elementary. And the an- swers may seem self-evident to the point of ap- pearing naïve. But managing oneself requires new and unprecedented things from the indi- vidual, and especially from the knowledge worker. In effect, managing oneself demands that each knowledge worker think and behave like a chief executive ofﬁcer.

Drucker by T . George Harris Harvard Business Review May–June 1993 Product no. 93302 Drucker explores the importance of self- management in the world of work. Corpora- tions once built to last like the pyramids are now more like tents, he says. Thus individuals need to take responsibility for their own ca- reers. Instead of assuming a traditional career trajectory up the corporate ladder, think in terms of a succession of professional assign- ments or projects. In today’s organizations, competence is mea- sured less in terms of subject matter and more in terms of abilities—for example, em- pathy and stamina under pressure. So it’s up to you to help others understand what you’re able to contribute to the overall project. Drucker also notes that your role as an exec- utive or manager has changed. You no longer manage a workforce; you manage in- dividuals with a variety of skills. Your job, then, is to combine these skills in a variety of configurations to create the best results for your company. How to Play to Your Strengths by Laura Morgan Roberts, Gretchen Spreitzer, Jane Dutton, Robert Quinn, Emily Heaphy, and Brianna Barker Harvard Business Review January 2005 Product no. R0501G Like Drucker, the authors of this article em- phasize the importance of understanding and leveraging your strengths. They present a feedback tool called the Reflective Best Self (RBS) exercise, which offers a feedback expe- rience distinct from performance reviews (that typically focus on problem areas). RBS enables you to tap into talents you may not be aware of and use them to enhance your career potential. To begin the exercise, solicit comments from family, friends, colleagues, and teachers— asking for specific examples of times when your unique strengths generated especially important benefits. Next, search for common themes among the feedback, organizing them in a table to develop a clear picture of your strong suits. Then write a self-portrait: a description of yourself that distills what you’ve learned from your feedback. Finally, redesign your personal job description so you can better shape the positions you choose to play—both now and in the next phase of your career.

We live in an age of unprecedented oppor- tunity: If you’ve got ambition, drive, and smarts, you can rise to the top of your cho- sen profession—regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes re- sponsibility. Companies today aren’t man- aging their knowledge workers’ careers. Rather, we must each be our own chief ex- ecutive officer. Simply put, it’s up to you to carve out your place in the work world and know when to change course. And it’s up to you to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do all of these things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of yourself. What are your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weaknesses? Equally im- portant, how do you learn and work with others? What are your most deeply held val- ues? And in what type of work environment can you make the greatest contribution? The implication is clear: Only when you op- erate from a combination of your strengths and self-knowledge can you achieve true— and lasting—excellence. To build a life of excellence, begin by asking yourself these questions: “What are my strengths?” To accurately identify your strengths, use feedback analysis . Every time you make a key decision, write down the outcome you ex- pect. Several months later, compare the actual results with your expected results. Look for patterns in what you’re seeing: What results are you skilled at generating? What abilities do you need to enhance in order to get the re- sults you want? What unproductive habits are preventing you from creating the outcomes you desire? In identifying opportunities for im- provement, don’t waste time cultivating skill areas where you have little competence. In- stead, concentrate on—and build on—your strengths. “How do I work?” In what ways do you work best? Do you pro- cess information most effectively by reading it, or by hearing others discuss it? Do you accomplish the most by working with other people, or by working alone? Do you per- form best while making decisions, or while advising others on key matters? Are you in top form when things get stressful, or do you function optimally in a highly predict- able environment? “What are my values?” What are your ethics? What do you see as your most important responsibilities for living a worthy, ethical life? Do your organization’s ethics resonate with your own values? If not, your career will likely be marked by frustration and poor performance. “Where do I belong?” Consider your strengths, preferred work style, and values. Based on these qualities, in what kind of work environment would you fit in best? Find the perfect fit, and you’ll transform yourself from a merely acceptable employee into a star performer. “What can I contribute?” In earlier eras, companies told businesspeople what their contribution should be. Today, you have choices. To decide how you can best en- hance your organization’s performance, first ask what the situation requires. Based on your strengths, work style, and values, how might you make the greatest contribution to your organization’s efforts?

Drucker harvard business review • january 2005 page 2 COPYRIGHT © 2004 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Success in the knowledge economy comes to those who know themselves—their strengths, their values, and how they best perform. We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: If you’ve got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren’t managing their employ- ees’ careers; knowledge workers must, effec- tively, be their own chief executive ofﬁcers. It’s up to you to carve out your place, to know when to change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do those things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of your- self—not only what your strengths and weak- nesses are but also how you learn, how you work with others, what your values are, and where you can make the greatest contribution. Because only when you operate from strengths can you achieve true excellence. History’s great achievers—a Napoléon, a da Vinci, a Mozart—have always managed them- selves. That, in large measure, is what makes them great achievers. But they are rare excep- tions, so unusual both in their talents and their accomplishments as to be considered outside the boundaries of ordinary human ex- istence. Now, most of us, even those of us with modest endowments, will have to learn to manage ourselves. We will have to learn to de- velop ourselves. We will have to place our- selves where we can make the greatest contri- bution. And we will have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do. What Are My Strengths? Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong. More often, people know what they are not good at—and even then more people are wrong than right. And yet, a person can perform only from strength. One cannot build performance on weaknesses, let alone on something one can- not do at all. Throughout history, people had little need to know their strengths. A person was This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 3 born into a position and a line of work: The peasant’s son would also be a peasant; the ar- tisan’s daughter, an artisan’s wife; and so on. But now people have choices. We need to know our strengths in order to know where we belong. The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations. I have been practicing this method for 15 to 20 years now, and every time I do it, I am surprised. The feedback analysis showed me, for instance—and to my great sur- prise—that I have an intuitive understanding of technical people, whether they are engi- neers or accountants or market researchers. It also showed me that I don’t really resonate with generalists. Feedback analysis is by no means new. It was invented sometime in the fourteenth cen- tury by an otherwise totally obscure German theologian and picked up quite independently, some 150 years later, by John Calvin and Igna- tius of Loyola, each of whom incorporated it into the practice of his followers. In fact, the steadfast focus on performance and results that this habit produces explains why the insti- tutions these two men founded, the Calvinist church and the Jesuit order, came to dominate Europe within 30 years. Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie—and this is the most important thing to know. The method will show you what you are doing or failing to do that de- prives you of the full beneﬁts of your strengths. It will show you where you are not particularly competent. And ﬁnally, it will show you where you have no strengths and cannot perform. Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. First and foremost, concen- trate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge—and those can usually be ﬁlled. Mathematicians are born, but everyone can learn trigonometry. Third, discover where your intellectual arro- gance is causing disabling ignorance and over- come it. Far too many people—especially peo- ple with great expertise in one area—are contemptuous of knowledge in other areas or believe that being bright is a substitute for knowledge. First-rate engineers, for instance, tend to take pride in not knowing anything about people. Human beings, they believe, are much too disorderly for the good engineering mind. Human resources professionals, by con- trast, often pride themselves on their igno- rance of elementary accounting or of quantita- tive methods altogether. But taking pride in such ignorance is self-defeating. Go to work on acquiring the skills and knowledge you need to fully realize your strengths. It is equally essential to remedy your bad habits—the things you do or fail to do that in- hibit your effectiveness and performance. Such habits will quickly show up in the feedback. For example, a planner may ﬁnd that his beau- tiful plans fail because he does not follow through on them. Like so many brilliant peo- ple, he believes that ideas move mountains. But bulldozers move mountains; ideas show where the bulldozers should go to work. This planner will have to learn that the work does not stop when the plan is completed. He must ﬁnd people to carry out the plan and explain it to them. He must adapt and change it as he puts it into action. And ﬁnally, he must decide when to stop pushing the plan. At the same time, feedback will also reveal when the problem is a lack of manners. Man- ners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. This is as true for human beings as it is for inanimate objects. Manners—simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and knowing a per- son’s name or asking after her family—enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. Bright people, espe- cially bright young people, often do not un- derstand this. If analysis shows that some- one’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy—that is, a lack of manners. Comparing your expectations with your re- sults also indicates what not to do. We all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becom- ing even mediocre. In those areas a person— Peter F . Drucker is the Marie Rankin Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management (Emeritus) at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, Cali- fornia.

One should waste as little effort as possible on im- proving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from in- competence to mediocrity than it takes to im- prove from ﬁrst-rate performance to excel- lence. And yet most people—especially most teachers and most organizations—concen- trate on making incompetent performers into mediocre ones. Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent per- son into a star performer. How Do I Perform? Amazingly few people know how they get things done. Indeed, most of us do not even know that different people work and perform differently. Too many people work in ways that are not their ways, and that almost guarantees nonperformance. For knowledge workers, How do I perform? may be an even more important question than What are my strengths? Like one’s strengths, how one performs is unique. It is a matter of personality. Whether personality be a matter of nature or nurture, it surely is formed long before a person goes to work. And how a person performs is a given, just as what a person is good at or not good at is a given. A person’s way of performing can be slightly modiﬁed, but it is unlikely to be com- pletely changed—and certainly not easily. Just as people achieve results by doing what they are good at, they also achieve results by work- ing in ways that they best perform. A few com- mon personality traits usually determine how a person performs. Am I a reader or a listener? The ﬁrst thing to know is whether you are a reader or a lis- tener. Far too few people even know that there are readers and listeners and that peo- ple are rarely both. Even fewer know which of the two they themselves are. But some ex- amples will show how damaging such igno- rance can be. When Dwight Eisenhower was Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, he was the darling of the press. His press confer- ences were famous for their style—General Eisenhower showed total command of what- ever question he was asked, and he was able to describe a situation and explain a policy in two or three beautifully polished and elegant sen- tences. Ten years later, the same journalists who had been his admirers held President Eisenhower in open contempt. He never ad- dressed the questions, they complained, but rambled on endlessly about something else. And they constantly ridiculed him for butcher- ing the King’s English in incoherent and un- grammatical answers. Eisenhower apparently did not know that he was a reader, not a listener. When he was Supreme Commander in Europe, his aides made sure that every question from the press was presented in writing at least half an hour before a conference was to begin. And then Eisenhower was in total command. When he became president, he succeeded two listeners, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Both men knew themselves to be listeners and both enjoyed free-for-all press conferences. Eisen- hower may have felt that he had to do what his two predecessors had done. As a result, he never even heard the questions journalists asked. And Eisenhower is not even an extreme case of a nonlistener. A few years later, Lyndon Johnson destroyed his presidency, in large measure, by not know- ing that he was a listener. His predecessor, John Kennedy, was a reader who had assem- bled a brilliant group of writers as his assis- tants, making sure that they wrote to him be- fore discussing their memos in person. Johnson kept these people on his staff—and they kept on writing. He never, apparently, understood one word of what they wrote. Yet as a senator, Johnson had been superb; for parliamentari- ans have to be, above all, listeners. Few listeners can be made, or can make themselves, into competent readers—and vice versa. The listener who tries to be a reader will, therefore, suffer the fate of Lyndon Johnson, whereas the reader who tries to be a listener will suffer the fate of Dwight Eisenhower. They will not perform or achieve. How do I learn? The second thing to know about how one performs is to know how one learns. Many ﬁrst-class writers—Winston Churchill is but one example—do poorly in school. They tend to remember their school- ing as pure torture. Yet few of their classmates remember it the same way. They may not have enjoyed the school very much, but the worst they suffered was boredom. The explanation is that writers do not, as a rule, learn by listening and reading. They learn by writing. Because schools do not allow them to learn this way, It takes far more energy to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than to improve from first-rate performance to excellence.

Schools everywhere are organized on the as- sumption that there is only one right way to learn and that it is the same way for everybody. But to be forced to learn the way a school teaches is sheer hell for students who learn dif- ferently. Indeed, there are probably half a dozen different ways to learn. There are people, like Churchill, who learn by writing. Some people learn by taking copi- ous notes. Beethoven, for example, left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks, yet he said he never actually looked at them when he composed. Asked why he kept them, he is re- ported to have replied, “If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it into a sketchbook, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again. ” Some people learn by doing. Others learn by hearing themselves talk. A chief executive I know who converted a small and mediocre family business into the leading company in its industry was one of those people who learn by talking. He was in the habit of calling his entire senior staff into his ofﬁce once a week and then talking at them for two or three hours. He would raise policy issues and argue three different positions on each one. He rarely asked his associates for comments or questions; he simply needed an audience to hear himself talk. That’s how he learned. And although he is a fairly extreme case, learning through talking is by no means an unusual method. Successful trial lawyers learn the same way, as do many medical diag- nosticians (and so do I). Of all the important pieces of self-knowledge, understanding how you learn is the easiest to acquire. When I ask people, “How do you learn?” most of them know the answer. But when I ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?” few answer yes. And yet, acting on this knowl- edge is the key to performance; or rather, not acting on this knowledge condemns one to nonperformance. Am I a reader or a listener? and How do I learn? are the ﬁrst questions to ask. But they are by no means the only ones. To manage yourself effectively, you also have to ask, Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship? Some people work best as subordinates. Gen- eral George Patton, the great American military hero of World War II, is a prime example. Patton was America’s top troop commander. Yet when he was proposed for an independent command, General George Marshall, the U.S. chief of staff—and probably the most successful picker of men in U.S. history—said, “Patton is the best subordinate the American army has ever pro- duced, but he would be the worst commander. ” Some people work best as team members. Others work best alone. Some are exception- ally talented as coaches and mentors; others are simply incompetent as mentors. Another crucial question is, Do I produce re- sults as a decision maker or as an adviser? A great many people perform best as advisers but cannot take the burden and pressure of making the decision. A good many other peo- ple, by contrast, need an adviser to force them- selves to think; then they can make decisions and act on them with speed, self-conﬁdence, and courage. This is a reason, by the way, that the num- ber two person in an organization often fails when promoted to the number one position. The top spot requires a decision maker. Strong decision makers often put somebody they trust into the number two spot as their adviser— and in that position the person is outstanding. But in the number one spot, the same person fails. He or she knows what the decision should be but cannot accept the responsibility of actu- ally making it. Other important questions to ask include, Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environ- ment? Do I work best in a big organization or a small one? Few people work well in all kinds of environments. Again and again, I have seen people who were very successful in large organizations ﬂounder miserably when they moved into smaller ones. And the re- verse is equally true. The conclusion bears repeating: Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to suc- ceed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you can- not perform or will only perform poorly. What Are My Values? To be able to manage yourself, you ﬁnally have to ask, What are my values? This is not a question of ethics. With respect to ethics, the rules are the same for everybody, and the test is a simple one. I call it the “mirror test. ” In the early years of this century, the most Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. Work to improve the way you perform.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 6 highly respected diplomat of all the great pow- ers was the German ambassador in London. He was clearly destined for great things—to become his country’s foreign minister, at least, if not its federal chancellor. Yet in 1906 he abruptly resigned rather than preside over a dinner given by the diplomatic corps for Ed- ward VII. The king was a notorious womanizer and made it clear what kind of dinner he wanted. The ambassador is reported to have said, “I refuse to see a pimp in the mirror in the morning when I shave. ” That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning? What is ethical behavior in one kind of orga- nization or situation is ethical behavior in an- other. But ethics is only part of a value sys- tem—especially of an organization’s value system. To work in an organization whose value sys- tem is unacceptable or incompatible with one’s own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance. Consider the experience of a highly success- ful human resources executive whose com- pany was acquired by a bigger organization. After the acquisition, she was promoted to do the kind of work she did best, which included selecting people for important positions. The executive deeply believed that a company should hire people for such positions from the outside only after exhausting all the inside pos- sibilities. But her new company believed in ﬁrst looking outside “to bring in fresh blood. ” There is something to be said for both ap- proaches—in my experience, the proper one is to do some of both. They are, however, funda- mentally incompatible—not as policies but as values. They bespeak different views of the re- lationship between organizations and people; different views of the responsibility of an orga- nization to its people and their development; and different views of a person’s most impor- tant contribution to an enterprise. After sev- eral years of frustration, the executive quit—at considerable ﬁnancial loss. Her values and the values of the organization simply were not compatible. Similarly, whether a pharmaceutical com- pany tries to obtain results by making constant, small improvements or by achieving occa- sional, highly expensive, and risky “break- throughs” is not primarily an economic ques- tion. The results of either strategy may be pretty much the same. At bottom, there is a conﬂict between a value system that sees the company’s contribution in terms of helping physicians do better what they already do and a value system that is oriented toward making scientiﬁc discoveries. Whether a business should be run for short- term results or with a focus on the long term is likewise a question of values. Financial ana- lysts believe that businesses can be run for both simultaneously. Successful businesspeo- ple know better. To be sure, every company has to produce short-term results. But in any conﬂict between short-term results and long- term growth, each company will determine its own priority. This is not primarily a disagree- ment about economics. It is fundamentally a value conﬂict regarding the function of a busi- ness and the responsibility of management. Value conﬂicts are not limited to business organizations. One of the fastest-growing pas- toral churches in the United States measures success by the number of new parishioners. Its leadership believes that what matters is how many newcomers join the congregation. The Good Lord will then minister to their spiritual needs or at least to the needs of a sufﬁcient percentage. Another pastoral, evan- gelical church believes that what matters is people’s spiritual growth. The church eases out newcomers who join but do not enter into its spiritual life. Again, this is not a matter of numbers. At ﬁrst glance, it appears that the second church grows more slowly. But it retains a far larger proportion of newcomers than the ﬁrst one does. Its growth, in other words, is more solid. This is also not a theological problem, or only secondarily so. It is a problem about values. In a public debate, one pastor argued, “Unless you ﬁrst come to church, you will never ﬁnd the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven. ” “No, ” answered the other. “Until you ﬁrst look for the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven, you don’t belong in church. ” Organizations, like people, have values. To be effective in an organization, a person’s val- ues must be compatible with the organiza- tion’s values. They do not need to be the same, but they must be close enough to coexist. Oth- erwise, the person will not only be frustrated but also will not produce results.

But there is sometimes a conﬂict between a person’s values and his or her strengths. What one does well—even very well and successfully—may not ﬁt with one’s value system. In that case, the work may not appear to be worth devoting one’s life to (or even a substantial portion thereof). If I may, allow me to interject a personal note. Many years ago, I too had to decide be- tween my values and what I was doing success- fully. I was doing very well as a young invest- ment banker in London in the mid-1930s, and the work clearly ﬁt my strengths. Yet I did not see myself making a contribution as an asset manager. People, I realized, were what I val- ued, and I saw no point in being the richest man in the cemetery. I had no money and no other job prospects. Despite the continuing Depression, I quit—and it was the right thing to do. Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test. Where Do I Belong? A small number of people know very early where they belong. Mathematicians, musi- cians, and cooks, for instance, are usually mathematicians, musicians, and cooks by the time they are four or ﬁve years old. Physi- cians usually decide on their careers in their teens, if not earlier. But most people, espe- cially highly gifted people, do not really know where they belong until they are well past their mid-twenties. By that time, how- ever, they should know the answers to the three questions: What are my strengths? How do I perform? and, What are my values? And then they can and should decide where they belong. Or rather, they should be able to decide where they do not belong. The person who has learned that he or she does not perform well in a big organization should have learned to say no to a position in one. The person who has learned that he or she is not a decision maker should have learned to say no to a deci- sion-making assignment. A General Patton (who probably never learned this himself) should have learned to say no to an indepen- dent command. Equally important, knowing the answer to these questions enables a person to say to an opportunity, an offer, or an assignment, “Yes, I will do that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be struc- tured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the kind of results you should ex- pect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am. ” Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for oppor- tunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person—hardworking and compe- tent but otherwise mediocre—into an out- standing performer. What Should I Contribute? Throughout history, the great majority of peo- ple never had to ask the question, What should I contribute? They were told what to contribute, and their tasks were dictated ei- ther by the work itself—as it was for the peas- ant or artisan—or by a master or a mistress— as it was for domestic servants. And until very recently, it was taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they were told. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the new knowledge workers (the so-called organi- zation men) looked to their company’s person- nel department to plan their careers. Then in the late 1960s, no one wanted to be told what to do any longer. Young men and women began to ask, What do I want to do? And what they heard was that the way to con- tribute was to “do your own thing. ” But this so- lution was as wrong as the organization men’s had been. Very few of the people who believed that doing one’s own thing would lead to con- tribution, self-fulﬁllment, and success achieved any of the three. But still, there is no return to the old an- swer of doing what you are told or assigned to do. Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three dis- tinct elements: What does the situation re- quire? Given my strengths, my way of per- forming, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And ﬁnally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference? Consider the experience of a newly ap- pointed hospital administrator. The hospital was big and prestigious, but it had been coasting on its reputation for 30 years. The What one does well— even very well and successfully—may not fit with one’s value system. This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 8 new administrator decided that his contribu- tion should be to establish a standard of ex- cellence in one important area within two years. He chose to focus on the emergency room, which was big, visible, and sloppy. He decided that every patient who came into the ER had to be seen by a qualiﬁed nurse within 60 seconds. Within 12 months, the hospital’s emergency room had become a model for all hospitals in the United States, and within an- other two years, the whole hospital had been transformed. As this example suggests, it is rarely possi- ble—or even particularly fruitful—to look too far ahead. A plan can usually cover no more than 18 months and still be reasonably clear and speciﬁc. So the question in most cases should be, Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half? The answer must bal- ance several things. First, the results should be hard to achieve—they should require “stretching, ” to use the current buzzword. But also, they should be within reach. To aim at results that cannot be achieved—or that can be only under the most unlikely circum- stances—is not being ambitious; it is being foolish. Second, the results should be mean- ingful. They should make a difference. Fi- nally, results should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable. From this will come a course of action: what to do, where and how to start, and what goals and deadlines to set. Responsibility for Relationships Very few people work by themselves and achieve results by themselves—a few great art- ists, a few great scientists, a few great athletes. Most people work with others and are effec- tive with other people. That is true whether they are members of an organization or inde- pendently employed. Managing yourself re- quires taking responsibility for relationships. This has two parts. The ﬁrst is to accept the fact that other peo- ple are as much individuals as you yourself are. They perversely insist on behaving like human beings. This means that they too have their strengths; they too have their ways of getting things done; they too have their values. To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the val- ues of your coworkers. That sounds obvious, but few people pay at- tention to it. Typical is the person who was trained to write reports in his or her ﬁrst as- signment because that boss was a reader. Even if the next boss is a listener, the person goes on writing reports that, invariably, produce no re- sults. Invariably the boss will think the em- ployee is stupid, incompetent, and lazy, and he or she will fail. But that could have been avoided if the employee had only looked at the new boss and analyzed how this boss performs. Bosses are neither a title on the organiza- tion chart nor a “function. ” They are individu- als and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to ﬁnd out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. The same holds true for all your coworkers. Each works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. What matters is whether they perform and what their values are. As for how they perform— each is likely to do it differently. The ﬁrst secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relation- ships are as much based on the people as they are on the work. The second part of relationship responsibil- ity is taking responsibility for communication. Whenever I, or any other consultant, start to work with an organization, the ﬁrst thing I hear about are all the personality conﬂicts. Most of these arise from the fact that people do not know what other people are doing and how they do their work, or what contribution the other people are concentrating on and what results they expect. And the reason they do not know is that they have not asked and therefore have not been told. This failure to ask reﬂects human stupidity less than it reﬂects human history. Until re- cently, it was unnecessary to tell any of these things to anybody. In the medieval city, every- one in a district plied the same trade. In the countryside, everyone in a valley planted the same crop as soon as the frost was out of the ground. Even those few people who did things that were not “common” worked alone, so they did not have to tell anyone what they were doing. Today the great majority of people work The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with so that you can make use of their strengths.

The marketing vice president may have come out of sales and know every- thing about sales, but she knows nothing about the things she has never done—pricing, advertising, packaging, and the like. So the people who do these things must make sure that the marketing vice president understands what they are trying to do, why they are trying to do it, how they are going to do it, and what results to expect. If the marketing vice president does not un- derstand what these high-grade knowledge specialists are doing, it is primarily their fault, not hers. They have not educated her. Con- versely, it is the marketing vice president’s re- sponsibility to make sure that all of her co- workers understand how she looks at marketing: what her goals are, how she works, and what she expects of herself and of each one of them. Even people who understand the impor- tance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufﬁciently with their associates. They are afraid of being thought presumptuous or inquisitive or stu- pid. They are wrong. Whenever someone goes to his or her associates and says, “This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values. This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be ex- pected to deliver, ” the response is always, “This is most helpful. But why didn’t you tell me earlier?” And one gets the same reaction—without exception, in my experience—if one continues by asking, “And what do I need to know about your strengths, how you perform, your values, and your proposed contribution?” In fact, knowledge workers should request this of ev- eryone with whom they work, whether as sub- ordinate, superior, colleague, or team member. And again, whenever this is done, the reaction is always, “Thanks for asking me. But why didn’t you ask me earlier?” Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust. The existence of trust between people does not necessarily mean that they like one another. It means that they under- stand one another. Taking responsibility for re- lationships is therefore an absolute necessity. It is a duty. Whether one is a member of the orga- nization, a consultant to it, a supplier, or a dis- tributor, one owes that responsibility to all one’s coworkers: those whose work one de- pends on as well as those who depend on one’s own work. The Second Half of Your Life When work for most people meant manual la- bor, there was no need to worry about the sec- ond half of your life. You simply kept on doing what you had always done. And if you were lucky enough to survive 40 years of hard work in the mill or on the railroad, you were quite happy to spend the rest of your life doing nothing. Today, however, most work is knowl- edge work, and knowledge workers are not “ﬁnished” after 40 years on the job, they are merely bored. We hear a great deal of talk about the midlife crisis of the executive. It is mostly boredom. At 45, most executives have reached the peak of their business careers, and they know it. After 20 years of doing very much the same kind of work, they are very good at their jobs. But they are not learning or contributing or deriving challenge and satisfaction from the job. And yet they are still likely to face an- other 20 if not 25 years of work. That is why managing oneself increasingly leads one to begin a second career. There are three ways to develop a second ca- reer. The ﬁrst is actually to start one. Often this takes nothing more than moving from one kind of organization to another: the divisional controller in a large corporation, for instance, becomes the controller of a medium-sized hos- pital. But there are also growing numbers of people who move into different lines of work altogether: the business executive or govern- ment ofﬁcial who enters the ministry at 45, for instance; or the midlevel manager who leaves corporate life after 20 years to attend law school and become a small-town attorney. We will see many more second careers un- dertaken by people who have achieved mod- est success in their ﬁrst jobs. Such people have substantial skills, and they know how to work. They need a community—the house is empty with the children gone—and they need income as well. But above all, they need challenge. The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career. Many people who are very successful in their ﬁrst careers stay in the work they have been doing, either on a full-time or part-time or con- This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

But in addition, they create a par- allel job, usually in a nonproﬁt organization, that takes another ten hours of work a week. They might take over the administration of their church, for instance, or the presidency of the local Girl Scouts council. They might run the battered women’s shelter, work as a chil- dren’s librarian for the local public library, sit on the school board, and so on. Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs. These are usually people who have been very successful in their ﬁrst careers. They love their work, but it no longer challenges them. In many cases they keep on doing what they have been doing all along but spend less and less of their time on it. They also start another activ- ity, usually a nonproﬁt. My friend Bob Buford, for example, built a very successful television company that he still runs. But he has also founded and built a successful nonproﬁt orga- nization that works with Protestant churches, and he is building another to teach social en- trepreneurs how to manage their own non- proﬁt ventures while still running their origi- nal businesses. People who manage the second half of their lives may always be a minority. The majority may “retire on the job” and count the years until their actual retirement. But it is this mi- nority, the men and women who see a long working-life expectancy as an opportunity both for themselves and for society, who will become leaders and models. There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin long before you enter it. When it ﬁrst became clear 30 years ago that working-life expectancies were lengthening very fast, many observers (including myself) believed that retired peo- ple would increasingly become volunteers for nonproﬁt institutions. That has not happened. If one does not begin to volunteer before one is 40 or so, one will not volunteer once past 60. Similarly, all the social entrepreneurs I know began to work in their chosen second en- terprise long before they reached their peak in their original business. Consider the example of a successful lawyer, the legal counsel to a large corporation, who has started a venture to establish model schools in his state. He began to do volunteer legal work for the schools when he was around 35. He was elected to the school board at age 40. At age 50, when he had amassed a fortune, he started his own enter- prise to build and to run model schools. He is, however, still working nearly full-time as the lead counsel in the company he helped found as a young lawyer. There is another reason to develop a second major interest, and to develop it early. No one can expect to live very long without experienc- ing a serious setback in his or her life or work. There is the competent engineer who is passed over for promotion at age 45. There is the com- petent college professor who realizes at age 42 that she will never get a professorship at a big university, even though she may be fully quali- ﬁed for it. There are tragedies in one’s family life: the breakup of one’s marriage or the loss of a child. At such times, a second major inter- est—not just a hobby—may make all the dif- ference. The engineer, for example, now knows that he has not been very successful in his job. But in his outside activity—as church trea- surer, for example—he is a success. One’s fam- ily may break up, but in that outside activity there is still a community. In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as “success. ” The overwhelming ma- jority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their “proper station, ” as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility. In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a success. This is clearly an im- possibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success, there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual’s family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a difference, and be somebody. That means ﬁnding a second area—whether in a second career, a parallel career, or a social venture— that offers an opportunity for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success. The challenges of managing oneself may seem obvious, if not elementary. And the an- swers may seem self-evident to the point of ap- pearing naïve. But managing oneself requires new and unprecedented things from the indi- vidual, and especially from the knowledge worker. In effect, managing oneself demands that each knowledge worker think and behave like a chief executive ofﬁcer.

Drucker by T . George Harris Harvard Business Review May–June 1993 Product no. 93302 Drucker explores the importance of self- management in the world of work. Corpora- tions once built to last like the pyramids are now more like tents, he says. Thus individuals need to take responsibility for their own ca- reers. Instead of assuming a traditional career trajectory up the corporate ladder, think in terms of a succession of professional assign- ments or projects. In today’s organizations, competence is mea- sured less in terms of subject matter and more in terms of abilities—for example, em- pathy and stamina under pressure. So it’s up to you to help others understand what you’re able to contribute to the overall project. Drucker also notes that your role as an exec- utive or manager has changed. You no longer manage a workforce; you manage in- dividuals with a variety of skills. Your job, then, is to combine these skills in a variety of configurations to create the best results for your company. How to Play to Your Strengths by Laura Morgan Roberts, Gretchen Spreitzer, Jane Dutton, Robert Quinn, Emily Heaphy, and Brianna Barker Harvard Business Review January 2005 Product no. R0501G Like Drucker, the authors of this article em- phasize the importance of understanding and leveraging your strengths. They present a feedback tool called the Reflective Best Self (RBS) exercise, which offers a feedback expe- rience distinct from performance reviews (that typically focus on problem areas). RBS enables you to tap into talents you may not be aware of and use them to enhance your career potential. To begin the exercise, solicit comments from family, friends, colleagues, and teachers— asking for specific examples of times when your unique strengths generated especially important benefits. Next, search for common themes among the feedback, organizing them in a table to develop a clear picture of your strong suits. Then write a self-portrait: a description of yourself that distills what you’ve learned from your feedback. Finally, redesign your personal job description so you can better shape the positions you choose to play—both now and in the next phase of your career.

      "  - actual output: Peter F. Drucker expounds upon the imperative of self-management in the modern knowledge economy, where individuals must act as their own chief executives. He posits that success relies on a deep comprehension of one's strengths, weaknesses, values, and preferred work styles. Drucker introduces feedback analysis as a tool to discover true strengths, urging individuals to concentrate on these areas for peak performance. He emphasizes that knowledge workers must consistently manage their personal development and contribute meaningfully to their organizations, fostering a sense of purpose through understanding and aligning with the values of their work environment.\n",

We live in an age of unprecedented oppor- tunity: If you’ve got ambition, drive, and smarts, you can rise to the top of your cho- sen profession—regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes re- sponsibility. Companies today aren’t man- aging their knowledge workers’ careers. Rather, we must each be our own chief ex- ecutive officer. Simply put, it’s up to you to carve out your place in the work world and know when to change course. And it’s up to you to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do all of these things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of yourself. What are your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weaknesses? Equally im- portant, how do you learn and work with others? What are your most deeply held val- ues? And in what type of work environment can you make the greatest contribution? The implication is clear: Only when you op- erate from a combination of your strengths and self-knowledge can you achieve true— and lasting—excellence. To build a life of excellence, begin by asking yourself these questions: “What are my strengths?” To accurately identify your strengths, use feedback analysis . Every time you make a key decision, write down the outcome you ex- pect. Several months later, compare the actual results with your expected results. Look for patterns in what you’re seeing: What results are you skilled at generating? What abilities do you need to enhance in order to get the re- sults you want? What unproductive habits are preventing you from creating the outcomes you desire? In identifying opportunities for im- provement, don’t waste time cultivating skill areas where you have little competence. In- stead, concentrate on—and build on—your strengths. “How do I work?” In what ways do you work best? Do you pro- cess information most effectively by reading it, or by hearing others discuss it? Do you accomplish the most by working with other people, or by working alone? Do you per- form best while making decisions, or while advising others on key matters? Are you in top form when things get stressful, or do you function optimally in a highly predict- able environment? “What are my values?” What are your ethics? What do you see as your most important responsibilities for living a worthy, ethical life? Do your organization’s ethics resonate with your own values? If not, your career will likely be marked by frustration and poor performance. “Where do I belong?” Consider your strengths, preferred work style, and values. Based on these qualities, in what kind of work environment would you fit in best? Find the perfect fit, and you’ll transform yourself from a merely acceptable employee into a star performer. “What can I contribute?” In earlier eras, companies told businesspeople what their contribution should be. Today, you have choices. To decide how you can best en- hance your organization’s performance, first ask what the situation requires. Based on your strengths, work style, and values, how might you make the greatest contribution to your organization’s efforts?

Success in the knowledge economy comes to those who know themselves—their strengths, their values, and how they best perform. We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: If you’ve got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren’t managing their employ- ees’ careers; knowledge workers must, effec- tively, be their own chief executive ofﬁcers. It’s up to you to carve out your place, to know when to change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. To do those things well, you’ll need to cultivate a deep understanding of your- self—not only what your strengths and weak- nesses are but also how you learn, how you work with others, what your values are, and where you can make the greatest contribution. Because only when you operate from strengths can you achieve true excellence. History’s great achievers—a Napoléon, a da Vinci, a Mozart—have always managed them- selves. That, in large measure, is what makes them great achievers. But they are rare excep- tions, so unusual both in their talents and their accomplishments as to be considered outside the boundaries of ordinary human ex- istence. Now, most of us, even those of us with modest endowments, will have to learn to manage ourselves. We will have to learn to de- velop ourselves. We will have to place our- selves where we can make the greatest contri- bution. And we will have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do. What Are My Strengths? Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong. More often, people know what they are not good at—and even then more people are wrong than right. And yet, a person can perform only from strength. One cannot build performance on weaknesses, let alone on something one can- not do at all. Throughout history, people had little need to know their strengths. A person was This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

But now people have choices. We need to know our strengths in order to know where we belong. The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations. I have been practicing this method for 15 to 20 years now, and every time I do it, I am surprised. The feedback analysis showed me, for instance—and to my great sur- prise—that I have an intuitive understanding of technical people, whether they are engi- neers or accountants or market researchers. It also showed me that I don’t really resonate with generalists. Feedback analysis is by no means new. It was invented sometime in the fourteenth cen- tury by an otherwise totally obscure German theologian and picked up quite independently, some 150 years later, by John Calvin and Igna- tius of Loyola, each of whom incorporated it into the practice of his followers. In fact, the steadfast focus on performance and results that this habit produces explains why the insti- tutions these two men founded, the Calvinist church and the Jesuit order, came to dominate Europe within 30 years. Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie—and this is the most important thing to know. The method will show you what you are doing or failing to do that de- prives you of the full beneﬁts of your strengths. It will show you where you are not particularly competent. And ﬁnally, it will show you where you have no strengths and cannot perform. Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. First and foremost, concen- trate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge—and those can usually be ﬁlled. Mathematicians are born, but everyone can learn trigonometry. Third, discover where your intellectual arro- gance is causing disabling ignorance and over- come it. Far too many people—especially peo- ple with great expertise in one area—are contemptuous of knowledge in other areas or believe that being bright is a substitute for knowledge. First-rate engineers, for instance, tend to take pride in not knowing anything about people. Human beings, they believe, are much too disorderly for the good engineering mind. Human resources professionals, by con- trast, often pride themselves on their igno- rance of elementary accounting or of quantita- tive methods altogether. But taking pride in such ignorance is self-defeating. Go to work on acquiring the skills and knowledge you need to fully realize your strengths. It is equally essential to remedy your bad habits—the things you do or fail to do that in- hibit your effectiveness and performance. Such habits will quickly show up in the feedback. For example, a planner may ﬁnd that his beau- tiful plans fail because he does not follow through on them. Like so many brilliant peo- ple, he believes that ideas move mountains. But bulldozers move mountains; ideas show where the bulldozers should go to work. This planner will have to learn that the work does not stop when the plan is completed. He must ﬁnd people to carry out the plan and explain it to them. He must adapt and change it as he puts it into action. And ﬁnally, he must decide when to stop pushing the plan. At the same time, feedback will also reveal when the problem is a lack of manners. Man- ners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. This is as true for human beings as it is for inanimate objects. Manners—simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and knowing a per- son’s name or asking after her family—enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. Bright people, espe- cially bright young people, often do not un- derstand this. If analysis shows that some- one’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy—that is, a lack of manners. Comparing your expectations with your re- sults also indicates what not to do. We all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becom- ing even mediocre. In those areas a person— Peter F . Drucker is the Marie Rankin Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management (Emeritus) at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, Cali- fornia.

One should waste as little effort as possible on im- proving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from in- competence to mediocrity than it takes to im- prove from ﬁrst-rate performance to excel- lence. And yet most people—especially most teachers and most organizations—concen- trate on making incompetent performers into mediocre ones. Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent per- son into a star performer. How Do I Perform? Amazingly few people know how they get things done. Indeed, most of us do not even know that different people work and perform differently. Too many people work in ways that are not their ways, and that almost guarantees nonperformance. For knowledge workers, How do I perform? may be an even more important question than What are my strengths? Like one’s strengths, how one performs is unique. It is a matter of personality. Whether personality be a matter of nature or nurture, it surely is formed long before a person goes to work. And how a person performs is a given, just as what a person is good at or not good at is a given. A person’s way of performing can be slightly modiﬁed, but it is unlikely to be com- pletely changed—and certainly not easily. Just as people achieve results by doing what they are good at, they also achieve results by work- ing in ways that they best perform. A few com- mon personality traits usually determine how a person performs. Am I a reader or a listener? The ﬁrst thing to know is whether you are a reader or a lis- tener. Far too few people even know that there are readers and listeners and that peo- ple are rarely both. Even fewer know which of the two they themselves are. But some ex- amples will show how damaging such igno- rance can be. When Dwight Eisenhower was Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, he was the darling of the press. His press confer- ences were famous for their style—General Eisenhower showed total command of what- ever question he was asked, and he was able to describe a situation and explain a policy in two or three beautifully polished and elegant sen- tences. Ten years later, the same journalists who had been his admirers held President Eisenhower in open contempt. He never ad- dressed the questions, they complained, but rambled on endlessly about something else. And they constantly ridiculed him for butcher- ing the King’s English in incoherent and un- grammatical answers. Eisenhower apparently did not know that he was a reader, not a listener. When he was Supreme Commander in Europe, his aides made sure that every question from the press was presented in writing at least half an hour before a conference was to begin. And then Eisenhower was in total command. When he became president, he succeeded two listeners, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Both men knew themselves to be listeners and both enjoyed free-for-all press conferences. Eisen- hower may have felt that he had to do what his two predecessors had done. As a result, he never even heard the questions journalists asked. And Eisenhower is not even an extreme case of a nonlistener. A few years later, Lyndon Johnson destroyed his presidency, in large measure, by not know- ing that he was a listener. His predecessor, John Kennedy, was a reader who had assem- bled a brilliant group of writers as his assis- tants, making sure that they wrote to him be- fore discussing their memos in person. Johnson kept these people on his staff—and they kept on writing. He never, apparently, understood one word of what they wrote. Yet as a senator, Johnson had been superb; for parliamentari- ans have to be, above all, listeners. Few listeners can be made, or can make themselves, into competent readers—and vice versa. The listener who tries to be a reader will, therefore, suffer the fate of Lyndon Johnson, whereas the reader who tries to be a listener will suffer the fate of Dwight Eisenhower. They will not perform or achieve. How do I learn? The second thing to know about how one performs is to know how one learns. Many ﬁrst-class writers—Winston Churchill is but one example—do poorly in school. They tend to remember their school- ing as pure torture. Yet few of their classmates remember it the same way. They may not have enjoyed the school very much, but the worst they suffered was boredom. The explanation is that writers do not, as a rule, learn by listening and reading. They learn by writing. Because schools do not allow them to learn this way, It takes far more energy to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than to improve from first-rate performance to excellence.

Schools everywhere are organized on the as- sumption that there is only one right way to learn and that it is the same way for everybody. But to be forced to learn the way a school teaches is sheer hell for students who learn dif- ferently. Indeed, there are probably half a dozen different ways to learn. There are people, like Churchill, who learn by writing. Some people learn by taking copi- ous notes. Beethoven, for example, left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks, yet he said he never actually looked at them when he composed. Asked why he kept them, he is re- ported to have replied, “If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it into a sketchbook, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again. ” Some people learn by doing. Others learn by hearing themselves talk. A chief executive I know who converted a small and mediocre family business into the leading company in its industry was one of those people who learn by talking. He was in the habit of calling his entire senior staff into his ofﬁce once a week and then talking at them for two or three hours. He would raise policy issues and argue three different positions on each one. He rarely asked his associates for comments or questions; he simply needed an audience to hear himself talk. That’s how he learned. And although he is a fairly extreme case, learning through talking is by no means an unusual method. Successful trial lawyers learn the same way, as do many medical diag- nosticians (and so do I). Of all the important pieces of self-knowledge, understanding how you learn is the easiest to acquire. When I ask people, “How do you learn?” most of them know the answer. But when I ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?” few answer yes. And yet, acting on this knowl- edge is the key to performance; or rather, not acting on this knowledge condemns one to nonperformance. Am I a reader or a listener? and How do I learn? are the ﬁrst questions to ask. But they are by no means the only ones. To manage yourself effectively, you also have to ask, Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship? Some people work best as subordinates. Gen- eral George Patton, the great American military hero of World War II, is a prime example. Patton was America’s top troop commander. Yet when he was proposed for an independent command, General George Marshall, the U.S. chief of staff—and probably the most successful picker of men in U.S. history—said, “Patton is the best subordinate the American army has ever pro- duced, but he would be the worst commander. ” Some people work best as team members. Others work best alone. Some are exception- ally talented as coaches and mentors; others are simply incompetent as mentors. Another crucial question is, Do I produce re- sults as a decision maker or as an adviser? A great many people perform best as advisers but cannot take the burden and pressure of making the decision. A good many other peo- ple, by contrast, need an adviser to force them- selves to think; then they can make decisions and act on them with speed, self-conﬁdence, and courage. This is a reason, by the way, that the num- ber two person in an organization often fails when promoted to the number one position. The top spot requires a decision maker. Strong decision makers often put somebody they trust into the number two spot as their adviser— and in that position the person is outstanding. But in the number one spot, the same person fails. He or she knows what the decision should be but cannot accept the responsibility of actu- ally making it. Other important questions to ask include, Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environ- ment? Do I work best in a big organization or a small one? Few people work well in all kinds of environments. Again and again, I have seen people who were very successful in large organizations ﬂounder miserably when they moved into smaller ones. And the re- verse is equally true. The conclusion bears repeating: Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to suc- ceed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you can- not perform or will only perform poorly. What Are My Values? To be able to manage yourself, you ﬁnally have to ask, What are my values? This is not a question of ethics. With respect to ethics, the rules are the same for everybody, and the test is a simple one. I call it the “mirror test. ” In the early years of this century, the most Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. Work to improve the way you perform.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 6 highly respected diplomat of all the great pow- ers was the German ambassador in London. He was clearly destined for great things—to become his country’s foreign minister, at least, if not its federal chancellor. Yet in 1906 he abruptly resigned rather than preside over a dinner given by the diplomatic corps for Ed- ward VII. The king was a notorious womanizer and made it clear what kind of dinner he wanted. The ambassador is reported to have said, “I refuse to see a pimp in the mirror in the morning when I shave. ” That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning? What is ethical behavior in one kind of orga- nization or situation is ethical behavior in an- other. But ethics is only part of a value sys- tem—especially of an organization’s value system. To work in an organization whose value sys- tem is unacceptable or incompatible with one’s own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance. Consider the experience of a highly success- ful human resources executive whose com- pany was acquired by a bigger organization. After the acquisition, she was promoted to do the kind of work she did best, which included selecting people for important positions. The executive deeply believed that a company should hire people for such positions from the outside only after exhausting all the inside pos- sibilities. But her new company believed in ﬁrst looking outside “to bring in fresh blood. ” There is something to be said for both ap- proaches—in my experience, the proper one is to do some of both. They are, however, funda- mentally incompatible—not as policies but as values. They bespeak different views of the re- lationship between organizations and people; different views of the responsibility of an orga- nization to its people and their development; and different views of a person’s most impor- tant contribution to an enterprise. After sev- eral years of frustration, the executive quit—at considerable ﬁnancial loss. Her values and the values of the organization simply were not compatible. Similarly, whether a pharmaceutical com- pany tries to obtain results by making constant, small improvements or by achieving occa- sional, highly expensive, and risky “break- throughs” is not primarily an economic ques- tion. The results of either strategy may be pretty much the same. At bottom, there is a conﬂict between a value system that sees the company’s contribution in terms of helping physicians do better what they already do and a value system that is oriented toward making scientiﬁc discoveries. Whether a business should be run for short- term results or with a focus on the long term is likewise a question of values. Financial ana- lysts believe that businesses can be run for both simultaneously. Successful businesspeo- ple know better. To be sure, every company has to produce short-term results. But in any conﬂict between short-term results and long- term growth, each company will determine its own priority. This is not primarily a disagree- ment about economics. It is fundamentally a value conﬂict regarding the function of a busi- ness and the responsibility of management. Value conﬂicts are not limited to business organizations. One of the fastest-growing pas- toral churches in the United States measures success by the number of new parishioners. Its leadership believes that what matters is how many newcomers join the congregation. The Good Lord will then minister to their spiritual needs or at least to the needs of a sufﬁcient percentage. Another pastoral, evan- gelical church believes that what matters is people’s spiritual growth. The church eases out newcomers who join but do not enter into its spiritual life. Again, this is not a matter of numbers. At ﬁrst glance, it appears that the second church grows more slowly. But it retains a far larger proportion of newcomers than the ﬁrst one does. Its growth, in other words, is more solid. This is also not a theological problem, or only secondarily so. It is a problem about values. In a public debate, one pastor argued, “Unless you ﬁrst come to church, you will never ﬁnd the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven. ” “No, ” answered the other. “Until you ﬁrst look for the gate to the Kingdom of Heaven, you don’t belong in church. ” Organizations, like people, have values. To be effective in an organization, a person’s val- ues must be compatible with the organiza- tion’s values. They do not need to be the same, but they must be close enough to coexist. Oth- erwise, the person will not only be frustrated but also will not produce results.

But there is sometimes a conﬂict between a person’s values and his or her strengths. What one does well—even very well and successfully—may not ﬁt with one’s value system. In that case, the work may not appear to be worth devoting one’s life to (or even a substantial portion thereof). If I may, allow me to interject a personal note. Many years ago, I too had to decide be- tween my values and what I was doing success- fully. I was doing very well as a young invest- ment banker in London in the mid-1930s, and the work clearly ﬁt my strengths. Yet I did not see myself making a contribution as an asset manager. People, I realized, were what I val- ued, and I saw no point in being the richest man in the cemetery. I had no money and no other job prospects. Despite the continuing Depression, I quit—and it was the right thing to do. Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test. Where Do I Belong? A small number of people know very early where they belong. Mathematicians, musi- cians, and cooks, for instance, are usually mathematicians, musicians, and cooks by the time they are four or ﬁve years old. Physi- cians usually decide on their careers in their teens, if not earlier. But most people, espe- cially highly gifted people, do not really know where they belong until they are well past their mid-twenties. By that time, how- ever, they should know the answers to the three questions: What are my strengths? How do I perform? and, What are my values? And then they can and should decide where they belong. Or rather, they should be able to decide where they do not belong. The person who has learned that he or she does not perform well in a big organization should have learned to say no to a position in one. The person who has learned that he or she is not a decision maker should have learned to say no to a deci- sion-making assignment. A General Patton (who probably never learned this himself) should have learned to say no to an indepen- dent command. Equally important, knowing the answer to these questions enables a person to say to an opportunity, an offer, or an assignment, “Yes, I will do that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be struc- tured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the kind of results you should ex- pect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am. ” Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for oppor- tunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person—hardworking and compe- tent but otherwise mediocre—into an out- standing performer. What Should I Contribute? Throughout history, the great majority of peo- ple never had to ask the question, What should I contribute? They were told what to contribute, and their tasks were dictated ei- ther by the work itself—as it was for the peas- ant or artisan—or by a master or a mistress— as it was for domestic servants. And until very recently, it was taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they were told. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the new knowledge workers (the so-called organi- zation men) looked to their company’s person- nel department to plan their careers. Then in the late 1960s, no one wanted to be told what to do any longer. Young men and women began to ask, What do I want to do? And what they heard was that the way to con- tribute was to “do your own thing. ” But this so- lution was as wrong as the organization men’s had been. Very few of the people who believed that doing one’s own thing would lead to con- tribution, self-fulﬁllment, and success achieved any of the three. But still, there is no return to the old an- swer of doing what you are told or assigned to do. Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three dis- tinct elements: What does the situation re- quire? Given my strengths, my way of per- forming, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And ﬁnally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference? Consider the experience of a newly ap- pointed hospital administrator. The hospital was big and prestigious, but it had been coasting on its reputation for 30 years.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 8 new administrator decided that his contribu- tion should be to establish a standard of ex- cellence in one important area within two years. He chose to focus on the emergency room, which was big, visible, and sloppy. He decided that every patient who came into the ER had to be seen by a qualiﬁed nurse within 60 seconds. Within 12 months, the hospital’s emergency room had become a model for all hospitals in the United States, and within an- other two years, the whole hospital had been transformed. As this example suggests, it is rarely possi- ble—or even particularly fruitful—to look too far ahead. A plan can usually cover no more than 18 months and still be reasonably clear and speciﬁc. So the question in most cases should be, Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half? The answer must bal- ance several things. First, the results should be hard to achieve—they should require “stretching, ” to use the current buzzword. But also, they should be within reach. To aim at results that cannot be achieved—or that can be only under the most unlikely circum- stances—is not being ambitious; it is being foolish. Second, the results should be mean- ingful. They should make a difference. Fi- nally, results should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable. From this will come a course of action: what to do, where and how to start, and what goals and deadlines to set. Responsibility for Relationships Very few people work by themselves and achieve results by themselves—a few great art- ists, a few great scientists, a few great athletes. Most people work with others and are effec- tive with other people. That is true whether they are members of an organization or inde- pendently employed. Managing yourself re- quires taking responsibility for relationships. This has two parts. The ﬁrst is to accept the fact that other peo- ple are as much individuals as you yourself are. They perversely insist on behaving like human beings. This means that they too have their strengths; they too have their ways of getting things done; they too have their values. To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the val- ues of your coworkers. That sounds obvious, but few people pay at- tention to it. Typical is the person who was trained to write reports in his or her ﬁrst as- signment because that boss was a reader. Even if the next boss is a listener, the person goes on writing reports that, invariably, produce no re- sults. Invariably the boss will think the em- ployee is stupid, incompetent, and lazy, and he or she will fail. But that could have been avoided if the employee had only looked at the new boss and analyzed how this boss performs. Bosses are neither a title on the organiza- tion chart nor a “function. ” They are individu- als and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to ﬁnd out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. The same holds true for all your coworkers. Each works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. What matters is whether they perform and what their values are. As for how they perform— each is likely to do it differently. The ﬁrst secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relation- ships are as much based on the people as they are on the work. The second part of relationship responsibil- ity is taking responsibility for communication. Whenever I, or any other consultant, start to work with an organization, the ﬁrst thing I hear about are all the personality conﬂicts. Most of these arise from the fact that people do not know what other people are doing and how they do their work, or what contribution the other people are concentrating on and what results they expect. And the reason they do not know is that they have not asked and therefore have not been told. This failure to ask reﬂects human stupidity less than it reﬂects human history. Until re- cently, it was unnecessary to tell any of these things to anybody. In the medieval city, every- one in a district plied the same trade. In the countryside, everyone in a valley planted the same crop as soon as the frost was out of the ground. Even those few people who did things that were not “common” worked alone, so they did not have to tell anyone what they were doing. Today the great majority of people work The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with so that you can make use of their strengths.

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 9 with others who have different tasks and re- sponsibilities. The marketing vice president may have come out of sales and know every- thing about sales, but she knows nothing about the things she has never done—pricing, advertising, packaging, and the like. So the people who do these things must make sure that the marketing vice president understands what they are trying to do, why they are trying to do it, how they are going to do it, and what results to expect. If the marketing vice president does not un- derstand what these high-grade knowledge specialists are doing, it is primarily their fault, not hers. They have not educated her. Con- versely, it is the marketing vice president’s re- sponsibility to make sure that all of her co- workers understand how she looks at marketing: what her goals are, how she works, and what she expects of herself and of each one of them. Even people who understand the impor- tance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufﬁciently with their associates. They are afraid of being thought presumptuous or inquisitive or stu- pid. They are wrong. Whenever someone goes to his or her associates and says, “This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values. This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be ex- pected to deliver, ” the response is always, “This is most helpful. But why didn’t you tell me earlier?” And one gets the same reaction—without exception, in my experience—if one continues by asking, “And what do I need to know about your strengths, how you perform, your values, and your proposed contribution?” In fact, knowledge workers should request this of ev- eryone with whom they work, whether as sub- ordinate, superior, colleague, or team member. And again, whenever this is done, the reaction is always, “Thanks for asking me. But why didn’t you ask me earlier?” Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust. The existence of trust between people does not necessarily mean that they like one another. It means that they under- stand one another. Taking responsibility for re- lationships is therefore an absolute necessity. It is a duty. Whether one is a member of the orga- nization, a consultant to it, a supplier, or a dis- tributor, one owes that responsibility to all one’s coworkers: those whose work one de- pends on as well as those who depend on one’s own work. The Second Half of Your Life When work for most people meant manual la- bor, there was no need to worry about the sec- ond half of your life. You simply kept on doing what you had always done. And if you were lucky enough to survive 40 years of hard work in the mill or on the railroad, you were quite happy to spend the rest of your life doing nothing. Today, however, most work is knowl- edge work, and knowledge workers are not “ﬁnished” after 40 years on the job, they are merely bored. We hear a great deal of talk about the midlife crisis of the executive. It is mostly boredom. At 45, most executives have reached the peak of their business careers, and they know it. After 20 years of doing very much the same kind of work, they are very good at their jobs. But they are not learning or contributing or deriving challenge and satisfaction from the job. And yet they are still likely to face an- other 20 if not 25 years of work. That is why managing oneself increasingly leads one to begin a second career. There are three ways to develop a second ca- reer. The ﬁrst is actually to start one. Often this takes nothing more than moving from one kind of organization to another: the divisional controller in a large corporation, for instance, becomes the controller of a medium-sized hos- pital. But there are also growing numbers of people who move into different lines of work altogether: the business executive or govern- ment ofﬁcial who enters the ministry at 45, for instance; or the midlevel manager who leaves corporate life after 20 years to attend law school and become a small-town attorney. We will see many more second careers un- dertaken by people who have achieved mod- est success in their ﬁrst jobs. Such people have substantial skills, and they know how to work. They need a community—the house is empty with the children gone—and they need income as well. But above all, they need challenge. The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career. Many people who are very successful in their ﬁrst careers stay in the work they have been doing, either on a full-time or part-time or con- This document is authorized for use only by Sharon Brooks (SHARON@PRICE-ASSOCIATES.COM).

Managing Oneself • • • B EST OF HBR 1999 harvard business review • january 2005 page 10 sulting basis. But in addition, they create a par- allel job, usually in a nonproﬁt organization, that takes another ten hours of work a week. They might take over the administration of their church, for instance, or the presidency of the local Girl Scouts council. They might run the battered women’s shelter, work as a chil- dren’s librarian for the local public library, sit on the school board, and so on. Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs. These are usually people who have been very successful in their ﬁrst careers. They love their work, but it no longer challenges them. In many cases they keep on doing what they have been doing all along but spend less and less of their time on it. They also start another activ- ity, usually a nonproﬁt. My friend Bob Buford, for example, built a very successful television company that he still runs. But he has also founded and built a successful nonproﬁt orga- nization that works with Protestant churches, and he is building another to teach social en- trepreneurs how to manage their own non- proﬁt ventures while still running their origi- nal businesses. People who manage the second half of their lives may always be a minority. The majority may “retire on the job” and count the years until their actual retirement. But it is this mi- nority, the men and women who see a long working-life expectancy as an opportunity both for themselves and for society, who will become leaders and models. There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin long before you enter it. When it ﬁrst became clear 30 years ago that working-life expectancies were lengthening very fast, many observers (including myself) believed that retired peo- ple would increasingly become volunteers for nonproﬁt institutions. That has not happened. If one does not begin to volunteer before one is 40 or so, one will not volunteer once past 60. Similarly, all the social entrepreneurs I know began to work in their chosen second en- terprise long before they reached their peak in their original business. Consider the example of a successful lawyer, the legal counsel to a large corporation, who has started a venture to establish model schools in his state. He began to do volunteer legal work for the schools when he was around 35. He was elected to the school board at age 40. At age 50, when he had amassed a fortune, he started his own enter- prise to build and to run model schools. He is, however, still working nearly full-time as the lead counsel in the company he helped found as a young lawyer. There is another reason to develop a second major interest, and to develop it early. No one can expect to live very long without experienc- ing a serious setback in his or her life or work. There is the competent engineer who is passed over for promotion at age 45. There is the com- petent college professor who realizes at age 42 that she will never get a professorship at a big university, even though she may be fully quali- ﬁed for it. There are tragedies in one’s family life: the breakup of one’s marriage or the loss of a child. At such times, a second major inter- est—not just a hobby—may make all the dif- ference. The engineer, for example, now knows that he has not been very successful in his job. But in his outside activity—as church trea- surer, for example—he is a success. One’s fam- ily may break up, but in that outside activity there is still a community. In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as “success. ” The overwhelming ma- jority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their “proper station, ” as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility. In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a success. This is clearly an im- possibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success, there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual’s family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a difference, and be somebody. That means ﬁnding a second area—whether in a second career, a parallel career, or a social venture— that offers an opportunity for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success. The challenges of managing oneself may seem obvious, if not elementary. And the an- swers may seem self-evident to the point of ap- pearing naïve. But managing oneself requires new and unprecedented things from the indi- vidual, and especially from the knowledge worker. In effect, managing oneself demands that each knowledge worker think and behave like a chief executive ofﬁcer. Further, the shift from manual workers who do as they are told There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin doing so long before you enter it.

Drucker by T . George Harris Harvard Business Review May–June 1993 Product no. 93302 Drucker explores the importance of self- management in the world of work. Corpora- tions once built to last like the pyramids are now more like tents, he says. Thus individuals need to take responsibility for their own ca- reers. Instead of assuming a traditional career trajectory up the corporate ladder, think in terms of a succession of professional assign- ments or projects. In today’s organizations, competence is mea- sured less in terms of subject matter and more in terms of abilities—for example, em- pathy and stamina under pressure. So it’s up to you to help others understand what you’re able to contribute to the overall project. Drucker also notes that your role as an exec- utive or manager has changed. You no longer manage a workforce; you manage in- dividuals with a variety of skills. Your job, then, is to combine these skills in a variety of configurations to create the best results for your company. How to Play to Your Strengths by Laura Morgan Roberts, Gretchen Spreitzer, Jane Dutton, Robert Quinn, Emily Heaphy, and Brianna Barker Harvard Business Review January 2005 Product no. R0501G Like Drucker, the authors of this article em- phasize the importance of understanding and leveraging your strengths. They present a feedback tool called the Reflective Best Self (RBS) exercise, which offers a feedback expe- rience distinct from performance reviews (that typically focus on problem areas). RBS enables you to tap into talents you may not be aware of and use them to enhance your career potential. To begin the exercise, solicit comments from family, friends, colleagues, and teachers— asking for specific examples of times when your unique strengths generated especially important benefits. Next, search for common themes among the feedback, organizing them in a table to develop a clear picture of your strong suits. Then write a self-portrait: a description of yourself that distills what you’ve learned from your feedback. Finally, redesign your personal job description so you can better shape the positions you choose to play—both now and in the next phase of your career.
