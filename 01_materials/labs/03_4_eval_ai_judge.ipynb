He jumps onto a boat in Harwich, on the trail of the infamous criminal Flambeau, who had slipped through the fingers of law enforcement in various thrilling episodes nationwide. Amidst the chaos of an important congress in London, Valentin is on a quest to arrest Flambeau, whose escapades range from elaborate scams to bewildering heists, including impersonating clergy!\\n\\nAs Valentin follows leads and engages with unsuspecting locals—including a bumbling little priest—he artfully uncovers subtle clues that lead him through a series of entertaining misadventures. His search unveils Flambeau\\'s attempts to steal a coveted sapphire cross from said priest, the gawky Father Brown. Oddities pervade the narrative, from mistakenly switching salt and sugar to peculiar rental encounters in the bustling streets of London. They infuse the plot with humor and anticipation, keeping readers guessing Valentin’s next move.\\n\\nIn a thrilling climax that juxtaposes sheer simplicity with layered cunning, Father Brown turns the tables on Flambeau, outsmarting the criminal with his cunning foresight and moral clarity.

      "tall duchess, he might have arrested them on the spot. But all along his\n",
      "train there was nobody that could be a disguised Flambeau, any more than\n",
      "a cat could be a disguised giraffe. About the people on the boat he had\n",
      "already satisfied himself; and the people picked up at Harwich or on\n",
      "the journey limited themselves with certainty to six. There was a short\n",
      "railway official travelling up to the terminus, three fairly short\n",
      "market gardeners picked up two stations afterwards, one very short widow\n",
      "lady going up from a small Essex town, and a very short Roman Catholic\n",
      "priest going up from a small Essex village. When it came to the last\n",
      "case, Valentin gave it up and almost laughed. The little priest was so\n",
      "much the essence of those Eastern flats; he had a face as round and dull\n",
      "as a Norfolk dumpling; he had eyes as empty as the North Sea; he had\n",
      "several brown paper parcels, which he was quite incapable of collecting.\n",
      "The Eucharistic Congress had doubtless sucked out of their local\n",
      "stagnation many such creatures, blind and helpless, like moles\n",
      "disinterred. Valentin was a sceptic in the severe style of France, and\n",
      "could have no love for priests. But he could have pity for them, and\n",
      "this one might have provoked pity in anybody. He had a large, shabby\n",
      "umbrella, which constantly fell on the floor. He did not seem to know\n",
      "which was the right end of his return ticket. He explained with a\n",
      "moon-calf simplicity to everybody in the carriage that he had to be\n",
      "careful, because he had something made of real silver “with blue stones”\n",
      " in one of his brown-paper parcels. His quaint blending of Essex flatness\n",
      "with saintly simplicity continuously amused the Frenchman till the\n",
      "priest arrived (somehow) at Tottenham with all his parcels, and came\n",
      "back for his umbrella. When he did the last, Valentin even had the good\n",
      "nature to warn him not to take care of the silver by telling everybody\n",
      "about it. But to whomever he talked, Valentin kept his eye open for\n",
      "someone else; he looked out steadily for anyone, rich or poor, male or\n",
      "female, who was well up to six feet; for Flambeau was four inches above\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He alighted at Liverpool Street, however, quite conscientiously secure\n",
      "that he had not missed the criminal so far. He then went to Scotland\n",
      "Yard to regularise his position and arrange for help in case of need; he\n",
      "then lit another cigarette and went for a long stroll in the streets of\n",
      "London. As he was walking in the streets and squares beyond Victoria, he\n",
      "paused suddenly and stood. It was a quaint, quiet square, very typical\n",
      "of London, full of an accidental stillness. The tall, flat houses round\n",
      "looked at once prosperous and uninhabited; the square of shrubbery in\n",
      "the centre looked as deserted as a green Pacific islet. One of the four\n",
      "sides was much higher than the rest, like a dais; and the line of this\n",
      "side was broken by one of London’s admirable accidents--a restaurant\n",
      "that looked as if it had strayed from Soho. It was an unreasonably\n",
      "attractive object, with dwarf plants in pots and long, striped blinds of\n",
      "lemon yellow and white. It stood specially high above the street, and in\n",
      "the usual patchwork way of London, a flight of steps from the street\n",
      "ran up to meet the front door almost as a fire-escape might run up to\n",
      "a first-floor window. Valentin stood and smoked in front of the\n",
      "yellow-white blinds and considered them long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen. A few\n",
      "clouds in heaven do come together into the staring shape of one human\n",
      "eye. A tree does stand up in the landscape of a doubtful journey in the\n",
      "exact and elaborate shape of a note of interrogation. I have seen both\n",
      "these things myself within the last few days. Nelson does die in the\n",
      "instant of victory; and a man named Williams does quite accidentally\n",
      "murder a man named Williamson; it sounds like a sort of infanticide.\n",
      "In short, there is in life an element of elfin coincidence which people\n",
      "reckoning on the prosaic may perpetually miss. As it has been well\n",
      "expressed in the paradox of Poe, wisdom should reckon on the unforeseen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aristide Valentin was unfathomably French; and the French intelligence\n",
      "is intelligence specially and solely. He was not “a thinking machine”;\n",
      "for that is a brainless phrase of modern fatalism and materialism. A\n",
      "machine only is a machine because it cannot think. But he was a thinking\n",
      "man, and a plain man at the same time. All his wonderful successes, that\n",
      "looked like conjuring, had been gained by plodding logic, by clear\n",
      "and commonplace French thought. The French electrify the world not by\n",
      "starting any paradox, they electrify it by carrying out a truism. They\n",
      "carry a truism so far--as in the French Revolution. But exactly because\n",

      "man who knows nothing of motors talks of motoring without petrol; only\n",
      "a man who knows nothing of reason talks of reasoning without strong,\n",
      "undisputed first principles. Here he had no strong first principles.\n",

      "he might be anything from a tall tramp on Wimbledon Common to a tall\n",
      "toast-master at the Hotel Metropole. In such a naked state of nescience,\n",
      "Valentin had a view and a method of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such cases he reckoned on the unforeseen. In such cases, when he\n",
      "could not follow the train of the reasonable, he coldly and carefully\n",
      "followed the train of the unreasonable. Instead of going to the right\n",
      "places--banks, police stations, rendezvous--he systematically went to\n",
      "the wrong places; knocked at every empty house, turned down every cul de\n",
      "sac, went up every lane blocked with rubbish, went round every crescent\n",
      "that led him uselessly out of the way. He defended this crazy course\n",
      "quite logically. He said that if one had a clue this was the worst way;\n",
      "but if one had no clue at all it was the best, because there was just\n",
      "the chance that any oddity that caught the eye of the pursuer might be\n",
      "the same that had caught the eye of the pursued. Somewhere a man must\n",
      "begin, and it had better be just where another man might stop. Something\n",
      "about that flight of steps up to the shop, something about the quietude\n",
      "and quaintness of the restaurant, roused all the detective’s rare\n",
      "romantic fancy and made him resolve to strike at random. He went up the\n",
      "steps, and sitting down at a table by the window, asked for a cup of\n",
      "black coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was half-way through the morning, and he had not breakfasted; the\n",
      "slight litter of other breakfasts stood about on the table to remind\n",
      "him of his hunger; and adding a poached egg to his order, he proceeded\n",
      "musingly to shake some white sugar into his coffee, thinking all the\n",
      "time about Flambeau. He remembered how Flambeau had escaped, once by a\n",
      "pair of nail scissors, and once by a house on fire; once by having to\n",
      "pay for an unstamped letter, and once by getting people to look through\n",
      "a telescope at a comet that might destroy the world. He thought his\n",
      "detective brain as good as the criminal’s, which was true. But he fully\n",
      "realised the disadvantage. “The criminal is the creative artist; the\n",
      "detective only the critic,” he said with a sour smile, and lifted his\n",
      "coffee cup to his lips slowly, and put it down very quickly. He had put\n",
      "salt in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the vessel from which the silvery powder had come; it\n",
      "was certainly a sugar-basin; as unmistakably meant for sugar as a\n",
      "champagne-bottle for champagne. He wondered why they should keep salt in\n",
      "it. He looked to see if there were any more orthodox vessels. Yes; there\n",
      "were two salt-cellars quite full. Perhaps there was some speciality in\n",
      "the condiment in the salt-cellars. He tasted it; it was sugar. Then he\n",
      "looked round at the restaurant with a refreshed air of interest, to see\n",
      "if there were any other traces of that singular artistic taste which\n",
      "puts the sugar in the salt-cellars and the salt in the sugar-basin.\n",
      "Except for an odd splash of some dark fluid on one of the white-papered\n",
      "walls, the whole place appeared neat, cheerful and ordinary. He rang the\n",
      "bell for the waiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "When that official hurried up, fuzzy-haired and somewhat blear-eyed at\n",
      "that early hour, the detective (who was not without an appreciation of\n",
      "the simpler forms of humour) asked him to taste the sugar and see if\n",
      "it was up to the high reputation of the hotel. The result was that the\n",
      "waiter yawned suddenly and woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you play this delicate joke on your customers every morning?”\n",
      " inquired Valentin. “Does changing the salt and sugar never pall on you\n",
      "as a jest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter, when this irony grew clearer, stammeringly assured him that\n",
      "the establishment had certainly no such intention; it must be a most\n",
      "curious mistake. He picked up the sugar-basin and looked at it; he\n",
      "picked up the salt-cellar and looked at that, his face growing more and\n",
      "more bewildered. At last he abruptly excused himself, and hurrying\n",
      "away, returned in a few seconds with the proprietor. The proprietor also\n",
      "examined the sugar-basin and then the salt-cellar; the proprietor also\n",
      "looked bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the waiter seemed to grow inarticulate with a rush of words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I zink,” he stuttered eagerly, “I zink it is those two clergy-men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What two clergymen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The two clergymen,” said the waiter, “that threw soup at the wall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Threw soup at the wall?” repeated Valentin, feeling sure this must be\n",
      "some singular Italian metaphor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” said the attendant excitedly, and pointed at the dark splash\n",
      "on the white paper; “threw it over there on the wall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Valentin looked his query at the proprietor, who came to his rescue with\n",
      "fuller reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” he said, “it’s quite true, though I don’t suppose it has\n",
      "anything to do with the sugar and salt. Two clergymen came in and drank\n",
      "soup here very early, as soon as the shutters were taken down. They were\n",
      "both very quiet, respectable people; one of them paid the bill and went\n",
      "out; the other, who seemed a slower coach altogether, was some minutes\n",
      "longer getting his things together. But he went at last. Only, the\n",
      "instant before he stepped into the street he deliberately picked up\n",
      "his cup, which he had only half emptied, and threw the soup slap on the\n",
      "wall. I was in the back room myself, and so was the waiter; so I could\n",
      "only rush out in time to find the wall splashed and the shop empty. It\n",
      "don’t do any particular damage, but it was confounded cheek; and I tried\n",
      "to catch the men in the street. They were too far off though; I only\n",
      "noticed they went round the next corner into Carstairs Street.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The detective was on his feet, hat settled and stick in hand. He had\n",
      "already decided that in the universal darkness of his mind he could\n",
      "only follow the first odd finger that pointed; and this finger was odd\n",
      "enough. Paying his bill and clashing the glass doors behind him, he was\n",
      "soon swinging round into the other street.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was fortunate that even in such fevered moments his eye was cool and\n",
      "quick. Something in a shop-front went by him like a mere flash; yet\n",
      "he went back to look at it. The shop was a popular greengrocer and\n",
      "fruiterer’s, an array of goods set out in the open air and plainly\n",
      "ticketed with their names and prices. In the two most prominent\n",
      "compartments were two heaps, of oranges and of nuts respectively. On\n",
      "the heap of nuts lay a scrap of cardboard, on which was written in bold,\n",
      "blue chalk, “Best tangerine oranges, two a penny.” On the oranges was\n",
      "the equally clear and exact description, “Finest Brazil nuts, 4d. a lb.”\n",
      " M. Valentin looked at these two placards and fancied he had met this\n",
      "highly subtle form of humour before, and that somewhat recently. He\n",
      "drew the attention of the red-faced fruiterer, who was looking\n",
      "rather sullenly up and down the street, to this inaccuracy in his\n",
      "advertisements. The fruiterer said nothing, but sharply put each\n",
      "card into its proper place. The detective, leaning elegantly on his\n",
      "walking-cane, continued to scrutinise the shop. At last he said, “Pray\n",
      "excuse my apparent irrelevance, my good sir, but I should like to ask\n",
      "you a question in experimental psychology and the association of ideas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The red-faced shopman regarded him with an eye of menace; but he\n",
      "continued gaily, swinging his cane, “Why,” he pursued, “why are two\n",
      "tickets wrongly placed in a greengrocer’s shop like a shovel hat that\n",
      "has come to London for a holiday? Or, in case I do not make myself\n",
      "clear, what is the mystical association which connects the idea of nuts\n",
      "marked as oranges with the idea of two clergymen, one tall and the other\n",
      "short?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The eyes of the tradesman stood out of his head like a snail’s; he\n",
      "really seemed for an instant likely to fling himself upon the stranger.\n",
      "At last he stammered angrily: “I don’t know what you ’ave to do with it,\n",
      "but if you’re one of their friends, you can tell ’em from me that I’ll\n",
      "knock their silly ’eads off, parsons or no parsons, if they upset my\n",
      "apples again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?” asked the detective, with great sympathy. “Did they upset your\n",
      "apples?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of ’em did,” said the heated shopman; “rolled ’em all over the\n",
      "street. I’d ’ave caught the fool but for havin’ to pick ’em up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which way did these parsons go?” asked Valentin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Up that second road on the left-hand side, and then across the square,”\n",
      " said the other promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks,” replied Valentin, and vanished like a fairy. On the other side\n",
      "of the second square he found a policeman, and said: “This is urgent,\n",
      "constable; have you seen two clergymen in shovel hats?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The policeman began to chuckle heavily. “I ’ave, sir; and if you arst\n",
      "me, one of ’em was drunk. He stood in the middle of the road that\n",
      "bewildered that--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which way did they go?” snapped Valentin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They took one of them yellow buses over there,” answered the man; “them\n",
      "that go to Hampstead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Valentin produced his official card and said very rapidly: “Call up two\n",
      "of your men to come with me in pursuit,” and crossed the road with such\n",
      "contagious energy that the ponderous policeman was moved to almost agile\n",
      "obedience. In a minute and a half the French detective was joined on the\n",
      "opposite pavement by an inspector and a man in plain clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir,” began the former, with smiling importance, “and what\n",
      "may--?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Valentin pointed suddenly with his cane. “I’ll tell you on the top of\n",
      "that omnibus,” he said, and was darting and dodging across the tangle of\n",
      "the traffic. When all three sank panting on the top seats of the yellow\n",
      "vehicle, the inspector said: “We could go four times as quick in a\n",
      "taxi.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite true,” replied their leader placidly, “if we only had an idea of\n",
      "where we were going.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, where are you going?” asked the other, staring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valentin smoked frowningly for a few seconds; then, removing his\n",
      "cigarette, he said: “If you know what a man’s doing, get in front of\n",
      "him; but if you want to guess what he’s doing, keep behind him. Stray\n",
      "when he strays; stop when he stops; travel as slowly as he. Then you may\n",
      "see what he saw and may act as he acted. All we can do is to keep our\n",
      "eyes skinned for a queer thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What sort of queer thing do you mean?” asked the inspector.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any sort of queer thing,” answered Valentin, and relapsed into\n",
      "obstinate silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yellow omnibus crawled up the northern roads for what seemed like\n",
      "hours on end; the great detective would not explain further, and perhaps\n",
      "his assistants felt a silent and growing doubt of his errand. Perhaps,\n",
      "also, they felt a silent and growing desire for lunch, for the hours\n",
      "crept long past the normal luncheon hour, and the long roads of the\n",
      "North London suburbs seemed to shoot out into length after length like\n",
      "an infernal telescope. It was one of those journeys on which a man\n",
      "perpetually feels that now at last he must have come to the end of the\n",
      "universe, and then finds he has only come to the beginning of Tufnell\n",
      "Park. London died away in draggled taverns and dreary scrubs, and then\n",
      "was unaccountably born again in blazing high streets and blatant hotels.\n",
      "It was like passing through thirteen separate vulgar cities all\n",
      "just touching each other. But though the winter twilight was already\n",
      "threatening the road ahead of them, the Parisian detective still sat\n",
      "silent and watchful, eyeing the frontage of the streets that slid by on\n",
      "either side. By the time they had left Camden Town behind, the policemen\n",
      "were nearly asleep; at least, they gave something like a jump as\n",
      "Valentin leapt erect, struck a hand on each man’s shoulder, and shouted\n",
      "to the driver to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "They tumbled down the steps into the road without realising why they\n",
      "had been dislodged; when they looked round for enlightenment they found\n",
      "Valentin triumphantly pointing his finger towards a window on the left\n",
      "side of the road. It was a large window, forming part of the long\n",
      "façade of a gilt and palatial public-house; it was the part reserved for\n",
      "respectable dining, and labelled “Restaurant.” This window, like all the\n",
      "rest along the frontage of the hotel, was of frosted and figured glass;\n",
      "but in the middle of it was a big, black smash, like a star in the ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our cue at last,” cried Valentin, waving his stick; “the place with the\n",
      "broken window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What window? What cue?” asked his principal assistant. “Why, what proof\n",
      "is there that this has anything to do with them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Valentin almost broke his bamboo stick with rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Proof!” he cried. “Good God! the man is looking for proof! Why, of\n",
      "course, the chances are twenty to one that it has nothing to do with\n",
      "them. But what else can we do? Don’t you see we must either follow one\n",
      "wild possibility or else go home to bed?” He banged his way into the\n",
      "restaurant, followed by his companions, and they were soon seated at a\n",
      "late luncheon at a little table, and looked at the star of smashed glass\n",
      "from the inside. Not that it was very informative to them even then.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Got your window broken, I see,” said Valentin to the waiter as he paid\n",
      "the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” answered the attendant, bending busily over the change, to\n",
      "which Valentin silently added an enormous tip. The waiter straightened\n",
      "himself with mild but unmistakable animation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, yes, sir,” he said. “Very odd thing, that, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?” Tell us about it,” said the detective with careless curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, two gents in black came in,” said the waiter; “two of those\n",
      "foreign parsons that are running about. They had a cheap and quiet\n",
      "little lunch, and one of them paid for it and went out. The other was\n",
      "just going out to join him when I looked at my change again and found\n",
      "he’d paid me more than three times too much. ‘Here,’ I says to the chap\n",
      "who was nearly out of the door, ‘you’ve paid too much.’ ‘Oh,’ he says,\n",
      "very cool, ‘have we?’ ‘Yes,’ I says, and picks up the bill to show him.\n",
      "Well, that was a knock-out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?” asked his interlocutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’d have sworn on seven Bibles that I’d put 4s. on that bill. But\n",
      "now I saw I’d put 14s., as plain as paint.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?” cried Valentin, moving slowly, but with burning eyes, “and\n",
      "then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The parson at the door he says all serene, ‘Sorry to confuse your\n",
      "accounts, but it’ll pay for the window.’ ‘What window?’ I says. ‘The\n",
      "one I’m going to break,’ he says, and smashed that blessed pane with his\n",
      "umbrella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All three inquirers made an exclamation; and the inspector said under\n",
      "his breath, “Are we after escaped lunatics?” The waiter went on with\n",
      "some relish for the ridiculous story:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was so knocked silly for a second, I couldn’t do anything. The man\n",
      "marched out of the place and joined his friend just round the corner.\n",
      "Then they went so quick up Bullock Street that I couldn’t catch them,\n",
      "though I ran round the bars to do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bullock Street,” said the detective, and shot up that thoroughfare as\n",
      "quickly as the strange couple he pursued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their journey now took them through bare brick ways like tunnels;\n",
      "streets with few lights and even with few windows; streets that seemed\n",
      "built out of the blank backs of everything and everywhere. Dusk was\n",
      "deepening, and it was not easy even for the London policemen to guess\n",
      "in what exact direction they were treading. The inspector, however, was\n",
      "pretty certain that they would eventually strike some part of Hampstead\n",
      "Heath. Abruptly one bulging gas-lit window broke the blue twilight like\n",
      "a bull’s-eye lantern; and Valentin stopped an instant before a little\n",
      "garish sweetstuff shop. After an instant’s hesitation he went in; he\n",
      "stood amid the gaudy colours of the confectionery with entire gravity\n",
      "and bought thirteen chocolate cigars with a certain care. He was clearly\n",
      "preparing an opening; but he did not need one.\n",
      "\n",
      "An angular, elderly young woman in the shop had regarded his elegant\n",
      "appearance with a merely automatic inquiry; but when she saw the door\n",
      "behind him blocked with the blue uniform of the inspector, her eyes\n",
      "seemed to wake up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” she said, “if you’ve come about that parcel, I’ve sent it off\n",
      "already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Parcel?” repeated Valentin; and it was his turn to look inquiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean the parcel the gentleman left--the clergyman gentleman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For goodness’ sake,” said Valentin, leaning forward with his first\n",
      "real confession of eagerness, “for Heaven’s sake tell us what happened\n",
      "exactly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said the woman a little doubtfully, “the clergymen came in about\n",
      "half an hour ago and bought some peppermints and talked a bit, and then\n",
      "went off towards the Heath. But a second after, one of them runs\n",
      "back into the shop and says, ‘Have I left a parcel!’ Well, I looked\n",
      "everywhere and couldn’t see one; so he says, ‘Never mind; but if it\n",
      "should turn up, please post it to this address,’ and he left me the\n",
      "address and a shilling for my trouble. And sure enough, though I thought\n",
      "I’d looked everywhere, I found he’d left a brown paper parcel, so I\n",
      "posted it to the place he said. I can’t remember the address now; it\n",
      "was somewhere in Westminster. But as the thing seemed so important, I\n",
      "thought perhaps the police had come about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So they have,” said Valentin shortly. “Is Hampstead Heath near here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Straight on for fifteen minutes,” said the woman, “and you’ll come\n",
      "right out on the open.” Valentin sprang out of the shop and began to\n",
      "run. The other detectives followed him at a reluctant trot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The street they threaded was so narrow and shut in by shadows that when\n",
      "they came out unexpectedly into the void common and vast sky they were\n",
      "startled to find the evening still so light and clear. A perfect dome\n",
      "of peacock-green sank into gold amid the blackening trees and the dark\n",
      "violet distances. The glowing green tint was just deep enough to pick\n",
      "out in points of crystal one or two stars. All that was left of the\n",
      "daylight lay in a golden glitter across the edge of Hampstead and that\n",
      "popular hollow which is called the Vale of Health. The holiday makers\n",
      "who roam this region had not wholly dispersed; a few couples sat\n",
      "shapelessly on benches; and here and there a distant girl still shrieked\n",
      "in one of the swings. The glory of heaven deepened and darkened around\n",
      "the sublime vulgarity of man; and standing on the slope and looking\n",
      "across the valley, Valentin beheld the thing which he sought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the black and breaking groups in that distance was one especially\n",
      "black which did not break--a group of two figures clerically clad.\n",
      "Though they seemed as small as insects, Valentin could see that one of\n",
      "them was much smaller than the other. Though the other had a student’s\n",
      "stoop and an inconspicuous manner, he could see that the man was well\n",
      "over six feet high. He shut his teeth and went forward, whirling his\n",
      "stick impatiently. By the time he had substantially diminished the\n",
      "distance and magnified the two black figures as in a vast microscope,\n",
      "he had perceived something else; something which startled him, and yet\n",
      "which he had somehow expected. Whoever was the tall priest, there could\n",
      "be no doubt about the identity of the short one. It was his friend of\n",
      "the Harwich train, the stumpy little cure of Essex whom he had warned\n",
      "about his brown paper parcels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, so far as this went, everything fitted in finally and rationally\n",
      "enough. Valentin had learned by his inquiries that morning that a Father\n",
      "Brown from Essex was bringing up a silver cross with sapphires, a\n",
      "relic of considerable value, to show some of the foreign priests at the\n",
      "congress. This undoubtedly was the “silver with blue stones”; and Father\n",
      "Brown undoubtedly was the little greenhorn in the train. Now there\n",
      "was nothing wonderful about the fact that what Valentin had found out\n",
      "Flambeau had also found out; Flambeau found out everything. Also there\n",
      "was nothing wonderful in the fact that when Flambeau heard of a sapphire\n",
      "cross he should try to steal it; that was the most natural thing in all\n",
      "natural history. And most certainly there was nothing wonderful about\n",
      "the fact that Flambeau should have it all his own way with such a silly\n",
      "sheep as the man with the umbrella and the parcels. He was the sort of\n",
      "man whom anybody could lead on a string to the North Pole; it was not\n",
      "surprising that an actor like Flambeau, dressed as another priest, could\n",
      "lead him to Hampstead Heath. So far the crime seemed clear enough; and\n",
      "while the detective pitied the priest for his helplessness, he almost\n",
      "despised Flambeau for condescending to so gullible a victim. But when\n",
      "Valentin thought of all that had happened in between, of all that had\n",
      "led him to his triumph, he racked his brains for the smallest rhyme or\n",
      "reason in it. What had the stealing of a blue-and-silver cross from a\n",
      "priest from Essex to do with chucking soup at wall paper? What had it\n",
      "to do with calling nuts oranges, or with paying for windows first and\n",
      "breaking them afterwards? He had come to the end of his chase; yet\n",
      "somehow he had missed the middle of it. When he failed (which was\n",
      "seldom), he had usually grasped the clue, but nevertheless missed the\n",
      "criminal. Here he had grasped the criminal, but still he could not grasp\n",
      "the clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two figures that they followed were crawling like black flies\n",
      "across the huge green contour of a hill. They were evidently sunk in\n",
      "conversation, and perhaps did not notice where they were going; but they\n",
      "were certainly going to the wilder and more silent heights of the Heath.\n",
      "As their pursuers gained on them, the latter had to use the undignified\n",
      "attitudes of the deer-stalker, to crouch behind clumps of trees and\n",
      "even to crawl prostrate in deep grass. By these ungainly ingenuities the\n",
      "hunters even came close enough to the quarry to hear the murmur of the\n",
      "discussion, but no word could be distinguished except the word “reason”\n",
      " recurring frequently in a high and almost childish voice. Once over\n",
      "an abrupt dip of land and a dense tangle of thickets, the detectives\n",
      "actually lost the two figures they were following. They did not find the\n",
      "trail again for an agonising ten minutes, and then it led round the brow\n",
      "of a great dome of hill overlooking an amphitheatre of rich and desolate\n",
      "sunset scenery. Under a tree in this commanding yet neglected spot was\n",
      "an old ramshackle wooden seat. On this seat sat the two priests still in\n",
      "serious speech together. The gorgeous green and gold still clung to\n",
      "the darkening horizon; but the dome above was turning slowly from\n",
      "peacock-green to peacock-blue, and the stars detached themselves more\n",
      "and more like solid jewels. Mutely motioning to his followers, Valentin\n",
      "contrived to creep up behind the big branching tree, and, standing there\n",
      "in deathly silence, heard the words of the strange priests for the first\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had listened for a minute and a half, he was gripped by a\n",
      "devilish doubt. Perhaps he had dragged the two English policemen to the\n",
      "wastes of a nocturnal heath on an errand no saner than seeking figs on\n",
      "its thistles. For the two priests were talking exactly like priests,\n",
      "piously, with learning and leisure, about the most aerial enigmas of\n",
      "theology. The little Essex priest spoke the more simply, with his round\n",
      "face turned to the strengthening stars; the other talked with his\n",
      "head bowed, as if he were not even worthy to look at them. But no more\n",
      "innocently clerical conversation could have been heard in any white\n",
      "Italian cloister or black Spanish cathedral.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first he heard was the tail of one of Father Brown’s sentences,\n",
      "which ended: “... what they really meant in the Middle Ages by the\n",
      "heavens being incorruptible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The taller priest nodded his bowed head and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, yes, these modern infidels appeal to their reason; but who can\n",
      "look at those millions of worlds and not feel that there may well be\n",
      "wonderful universes above us where reason is utterly unreasonable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the other priest; “reason is always reasonable, even in the\n",
      "last limbo, in the lost borderland of things. I know that people charge\n",
      "the Church with lowering reason, but it is just the other way. Alone\n",
      "on earth, the Church makes reason really supreme. Alone on earth, the\n",
      "Church affirms that God himself is bound by reason.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other priest raised his austere face to the spangled sky and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet who knows if in that infinite universe--?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only infinite physically,” said the little priest, turning sharply\n",
      "in his seat, “not infinite in the sense of escaping from the laws of\n",
      "truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Valentin behind his tree was tearing his fingernails with silent fury.\n",
      "He seemed almost to hear the sniggers of the English detectives whom\n",
      "he had brought so far on a fantastic guess only to listen to the\n",
      "metaphysical gossip of two mild old parsons. In his impatience he lost\n",
      "the equally elaborate answer of the tall cleric, and when he listened\n",
      "again it was again Father Brown who was speaking:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reason and justice grip the remotest and the loneliest star. Look\n",
      "at those stars. Don’t they look as if they were single diamonds and\n",
      "sapphires? Well, you can imagine any mad botany or geology you please.\n",
      "Think of forests of adamant with leaves of brilliants. Think the moon\n",
      "is a blue moon, a single elephantine sapphire. But don’t fancy that all\n",
      "that frantic astronomy would make the smallest difference to the reason\n",
      "and justice of conduct. On plains of opal, under cliffs cut out of\n",
      "pearl, you would still find a notice-board, ‘Thou shalt not steal.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Valentin was just in the act of rising from his rigid and crouching\n",
      "attitude and creeping away as softly as might be, felled by the one\n",
      "great folly of his life. But something in the very silence of the tall\n",
      "priest made him stop until the latter spoke. When at last he did speak,\n",
      "he said simply, his head bowed and his hands on his knees:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I think that other worlds may perhaps rise higher than our\n",
      "reason. The mystery of heaven is unfathomable, and I for one can only\n",
      "bow my head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, with brow yet bent and without changing by the faintest shade his\n",
      "attitude or voice, he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just hand over that sapphire cross of yours, will you? We’re all alone\n",
      "here, and I could pull you to pieces like a straw doll.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The utterly unaltered voice and attitude added a strange violence to\n",
      "that shocking change of speech. But the guarder of the relic only seemed\n",
      "to turn his head by the smallest section of the compass. He seemed still\n",
      "to have a somewhat foolish face turned to the stars. Perhaps he had not\n",
      "understood. Or, perhaps, he had understood and sat rigid with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the tall priest, in the same low voice and in the same still\n",
      "posture, “yes, I am Flambeau.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, after a pause, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, will you give me that cross?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the other, and the monosyllable had an odd sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flambeau suddenly flung off all his pontifical pretensions. The great\n",
      "robber leaned back in his seat and laughed low but long.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” he cried, “you won’t give it me, you proud prelate. You won’t give\n",
      "it me, you little celibate simpleton. Shall I tell you why you won’t\n",
      "give it me? Because I’ve got it already in my own breast-pocket.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The small man from Essex turned what seemed to be a dazed face in the\n",
      "dusk, and said, with the timid eagerness of “The Private Secretary”:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are--are you sure?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Flambeau yelled with delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, you’re as good as a three-act farce,” he cried. “Yes, you\n",
      "turnip, I am quite sure. I had the sense to make a duplicate of the\n",
      "right parcel, and now, my friend, you’ve got the duplicate and I’ve got\n",
      "the jewels. An old dodge, Father Brown--a very old dodge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Father Brown, and passed his hand through his hair with the\n",
      "same strange vagueness of manner. “Yes, I’ve heard of it before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The colossus of crime leaned over to the little rustic priest with a\n",
      "sort of sudden interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have heard of it?” he asked. “Where have you heard of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I mustn’t tell you his name, of course,” said the little man\n",
      "simply. “He was a penitent, you know. He had lived prosperously for\n",
      "about twenty years entirely on duplicate brown paper parcels. And so,\n",
      "you see, when I began to suspect you, I thought of this poor chap’s way\n",
      "of doing it at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Began to suspect me?” repeated the outlaw with increased intensity.\n",
      "“Did you really have the gumption to suspect me just because I brought\n",
      "you up to this bare part of the heath?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” said Brown with an air of apology. “You see, I suspected you\n",
      "when we first met. It’s that little bulge up the sleeve where you people\n",
      "have the spiked bracelet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How in Tartarus,” cried Flambeau, “did you ever hear of the spiked\n",
      "bracelet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, one’s little flock, you know!” said Father Brown, arching his\n",
      "eyebrows rather blankly. “When I was a curate in Hartlepool, there were\n",
      "three of them with spiked bracelets. So, as I suspected you from the\n",
      "first, don’t you see, I made sure that the cross should go safe, anyhow.\n",
      "I’m afraid I watched you, you know. So at last I saw you change the\n",
      "parcels. Then, don’t you see, I changed them back again. And then I left\n",
      "the right one behind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Left it behind?” repeated Flambeau, and for the first time there was\n",
      "another note in his voice beside his triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it was like this,” said the little priest, speaking in the same\n",
      "unaffected way. “I went back to that sweet-shop and asked if I’d left a\n",
      "parcel, and gave them a particular address if it turned up. Well, I knew\n",
      "I hadn’t; but when I went away again I did. So, instead of running after\n",
      "me with that valuable parcel, they have sent it flying to a friend of\n",
      "mine in Westminster.” Then he added rather sadly: “I learnt that, too,\n",
      "from a poor fellow in Hartlepool. He used to do it with handbags he\n",
      "stole at railway stations, but he’s in a monastery now. Oh, one gets to\n",
      "know, you know,” he added, rubbing his head again with the same sort of\n",
      "desperate apology. “We can’t help being priests. People come and tell us\n",
      "these things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Flambeau tore a brown-paper parcel out of his inner pocket and rent it\n",
      "in pieces. There was nothing but paper and sticks of lead inside it. He\n",
      "sprang to his feet with a gigantic gesture, and cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe you. I don’t believe a bumpkin like you could manage\n",
      "all that. I believe you’ve still got the stuff on you, and if you don’t\n",
      "give it up--why, we’re all alone, and I’ll take it by force!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Father Brown simply, and stood up also, “you won’t take it\n",
      "by force. First, because I really haven’t still got it. And, second,\n",
      "because we are not alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Flambeau stopped in his stride forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Behind that tree,” said Father Brown, pointing, “are two strong\n",
      "policemen and the greatest detective alive. How did they come here, do\n",
      "you ask? Why, I brought them, of course! How did I do it? Why, I’ll tell\n",
      "you if you like! Lord bless you, we have to know twenty such things\n",
      "when we work among the criminal classes! Well, I wasn’t sure you were\n",
      "a thief, and it would never do to make a scandal against one of our\n",
      "own clergy. So I just tested you to see if anything would make you show\n",
      "yourself. A man generally makes a small scene if he finds salt in his\n",
      "coffee; if he doesn’t, he has some reason for keeping quiet. I changed\n",
      "the salt and sugar, and you kept quiet. A man generally objects if\n",
      "his bill is three times too big. If he pays it, he has some motive for\n",
      "passing unnoticed. I altered your bill, and you paid it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The world seemed waiting for Flambeau to leap like a tiger. But he was\n",
      "held back as by a spell; he was stunned with the utmost curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” went on Father Brown, with lumbering lucidity, “as you wouldn’t\n",
      "leave any tracks for the police, of course somebody had to. At every\n",
      "place we went to, I took care to do something that would get us talked\n",
      "about for the rest of the day. I didn’t do much harm--a splashed wall,\n",
      "spilt apples, a broken window; but I saved the cross, as the cross will\n",
      "always be saved. It is at Westminster by now. I rather wonder you didn’t\n",
      "stop it with the Donkey’s Whistle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With the what?” asked Flambeau.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m glad you’ve never heard of it,” said the priest, making a face.\n",
      "“It’s a foul thing. I’m sure you’re too good a man for a Whistler. I\n",
      "couldn’t have countered it even with the Spots myself; I’m not strong\n",
      "enough in the legs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What on earth are you talking about?” asked the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I did think you’d know the Spots,” said Father Brown, agreeably\n",
      "surprised. “Oh, you can’t have gone so very wrong yet!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How in blazes do you know all these horrors?” cried Flambeau.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shadow of a smile crossed the round, simple face of his clerical\n",
      "opponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, by being a celibate simpleton, I suppose,” he said. “Has it never\n",
      "struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men’s real sins\n",
      "is not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil? But, as a matter of\n",
      "fact, another part of my trade, too, made me sure you weren’t a priest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” asked the thief, almost gaping.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You attacked reason,” said Father Brown. “It’s bad theology.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And even as he turned away to collect his property, the three policemen\n",

His actions are motivated by his desire for theft, particularly targeting valuable items such as the sapphire cross.

There was nothing notable about him, except a slight\\ncontrast between the holiday gaiety of his clothes and the official\\ngravity of his face. His clothes included a slight, pale grey jacket,\\na white waistcoat, and a silver straw hat with a grey-blue ribbon. His\\nlean face was dark by contrast, and ended in a curt black beard that\\nlooked Spanish and suggested an Elizabethan ruff. He was smoking a\\ncigarette with the seriousness of an idler. There was nothing about him\\nto indicate the fact that the grey jacket covered a loaded revolver,\\nthat the white waistcoat covered a police card, or that the straw hat\\ncovered one of the most powerful intellects in Europe. For this was\\nValentin himself, the head of the Paris police and the most famous\\ninvestigator of the world; and he was coming from Brussels to London to\\nmake the greatest arrest of the century.\\n\\nFlambeau was in England. The police of three countries had tracked the\\ngreat criminal at last from Ghent to Brussels, from Brussels to the Hook\\nof Holland; and it was conjectured that he would take some advantage of\\nthe unfamiliarity and confusion of the Eucharistic Congress, then\\ntaking place in London. Probably he would travel as some minor clerk\\nor secretary connected with it; but, of course, Valentin could not be\\ncertain; nobody could be certain about Flambeau.\\n\\nIt is many years now since this colossus of crime suddenly ceased\\nkeeping the world in a turmoil; and when he ceased, as they said after\\nthe death of Roland, there was a great quiet upon the earth. But in\\nhis best days (I mean, of course, his worst) Flambeau was a figure as\\nstatuesque and international as the Kaiser. Almost every morning the\\ndaily paper announced that he had escaped the consequences of one\\nextraordinary crime by committing another. He was a Gascon of gigantic\\nstature and bodily daring; and the wildest tales were told of his\\noutbursts of athletic humour; how he turned the juge d’instruction\\nupside down and stood him on his head, “to clear his mind”; how he ran\\ndown the Rue de Rivoli with a policeman under each arm. It is due to him\\nto say that his fantastic physical strength was generally employed in\\nsuch bloodless though undignified scenes; his real crimes were chiefly\\nthose of ingenious and wholesale robbery. But each of his thefts was\\nalmost a new sin, and would make a story by itself. It was he who ran\\nthe great Tyrolean Dairy Company in London, with no dairies, no cows, no\\ncarts, no milk, but with some thousand subscribers. These he served by\\nthe simple operation of moving the little milk cans outside people’s\\ndoors to the doors of his own customers. It was he who had kept up an\\nunaccountable and close correspondence with a young lady whose whole\\nletter-bag was intercepted, by the extraordinary trick of photographing\\nhis messages infinitesimally small upon the slides of a microscope. A\\nsweeping simplicity, however, marked many of his experiments. It is said\\nthat he once repainted all the numbers in a street in the dead of night\\nmerely to divert one traveller into a trap. It is quite certain that\\nhe invented a portable pillar-box, which he put up at corners in quiet\\nsuburbs on the chance of strangers dropping postal orders into it.\\nLastly, he was known to be a startling acrobat; despite his huge figure,\\nhe could leap like a grasshopper and melt into the tree-tops like a\\nmonkey. Hence the great Valentin, when he set out to find Flambeau, was\\nperfectly aware that his adventures would not end when he had found him.\\n\\nBut how was he to find him? On this the great Valentin’s ideas were\\nstill in process of settlement.\\n\\nThere was one thing which Flambeau, with all his dexterity of disguise,\\ncould not cover, and that was his singular height. If Valentin’s quick\\neye had caught a tall apple-woman, a tall grenadier, or even a tolerably\\ntall duchess, he might have arrested them on the spot. But all along his\\ntrain there was nobody that could be a disguised Flambeau, any more than\\na cat could be a disguised giraffe. About the people on the boat he had\\nalready satisfied himself; and the people picked up at Harwich or on\\nthe journey limited themselves with certainty to six. There was a short\\nrailway official travelling up to the terminus, three fairly short\\nmarket gardeners picked up two stations afterwards, one very short widow\\nlady going up from a small Essex town, and a very short Roman Catholic\\npriest going up from a small Essex village. When it came to the last\\ncase, Valentin gave it up and almost laughed. The little priest was so\\nmuch the essence of those Eastern flats; he had a face as round and dull\\nas a Norfolk dumpling; he had eyes as empty as the North Sea; he had\\nseveral brown paper parcels, which he was quite incapable of collecting.\\nThe Eucharistic Congress had doubtless sucked out of their local\\nstagnation many such creatures, blind and helpless, like moles\\ndisinterred. Valentin was a sceptic in the severe style of France, and\\ncould have no love for priests. But he could have pity for them, and\\nthis one might have provoked pity in anybody. He had a large, shabby\\numbrella, which constantly fell on the floor. He did not seem to know\\nwhich was the right end of his return ticket. He explained with a\\nmoon-calf simplicity to everybody in the carriage that he had to be\\ncareful, because he had something made of real silver “with blue stones”\\n in one of his brown-paper parcels. His quaint blending of Essex flatness\\nwith saintly simplicity continuously amused the Frenchman till the\\npriest arrived (somehow) at Tottenham with all his parcels, and came\\nback for his umbrella. When he did the last, Valentin even had the good\\nnature to warn him not to take care of the silver by telling everybody\\nabout it. But to whomever he talked, Valentin kept his eye open for\\nsomeone else; he looked out steadily for anyone, rich or poor, male or\\nfemale, who was well up to six feet; for Flambeau was four inches above\\nit.\\n\\nHe alighted at Liverpool Street, however, quite conscientiously secure\\nthat he had not missed the criminal so far. He then went to Scotland\\nYard to regularise his position and arrange for help in case of need; he\\nthen lit another cigarette and went for a long stroll in the streets of\\nLondon. As he was walking in the streets and squares beyond Victoria, he\\npaused suddenly and stood. It was a quaint, quiet square, very typical\\nof London, full of an accidental stillness. The tall, flat houses round\\nlooked at once prosperous and uninhabited; the square of shrubbery in\\nthe centre looked as deserted as a green Pacific islet. One of the four\\nsides was much higher than the rest, like a dais; and the line of this\\nside was broken by one of London’s admirable accidents--a restaurant\\nthat looked as if it had strayed from Soho. It was an unreasonably\\nattractive object, with dwarf plants in pots and long, striped blinds of\\nlemon yellow and white. It stood specially high above the street, and in\\nthe usual patchwork way of London, a flight of steps from the street\\nran up to meet the front door almost as a fire-escape might run up to\\na first-floor window. Valentin stood and smoked in front of the\\nyellow-white blinds and considered them long.\\n\\nThe most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen. A few\\nclouds in heaven do come together into the staring shape of one human\\neye. A tree does stand up in the landscape of a doubtful journey in the\\nexact and elaborate shape of a note of interrogation. I have seen both\\nthese things myself within the last few days. Nelson does die in the\\ninstant of victory; and a man named Williams does quite accidentally\\nmurder a man named Williamson; it sounds like a sort of infanticide.\\nIn short, there is in life an element of elfin coincidence which people\\nreckoning on the prosaic may perpetually miss. As it has been well\\nexpressed in the paradox of Poe, wisdom should reckon on the unforeseen.\\n\\nAristide Valentin was unfathomably French; and the French intelligence\\nis intelligence specially and solely. He was not “a thinking machine”;\\nfor that is a brainless phrase of modern fatalism and materialism. A\\nmachine only is a machine because it cannot think. But he was a thinking\\nman, and a plain man at the same time. All his wonderful successes, that\\nlooked like conjuring, had been gained by plodding logic, by clear\\nand commonplace French thought. The French electrify the world not by\\nstarting any paradox, they electrify it by carrying out a truism. They\\ncarry a truism so far--as in the French Revolution. But exactly because\\nValentin understood reason, he understood the limits of reason. Only a\\nman who knows nothing of motors talks of motoring without petrol; only\\na man who knows nothing of reason talks of reasoning without strong,\\nundisputed first principles. Here he had no strong first principles.\\nFlambeau had been missed at Harwich; and if he was in London at all,\\nhe might be anything from a tall tramp on Wimbledon Common to a tall\\ntoast-master at the Hotel Metropole. In such a naked state of nescience,\\nValentin had a view and a method of his own.\\n\\nIn such cases he reckoned on the unforeseen. In such cases, when he\\ncould not follow the train of the reasonable, he coldly and carefully\\nfollowed the train of the unreasonable. Instead of going to the right\\nplaces--banks, police stations, rendezvous--he systematically went to\\nthe wrong places; knocked at every empty house, turned down every cul de\\nsac, went up every lane blocked with rubbish, went round every crescent\\nthat led him uselessly out of the way. He defended this crazy course\\nquite logically. He said that if one had a clue this was the worst way;\\nbut if one had no clue at all it was the best, because there was just\\nthe chance that any oddity that caught the eye of the pursuer might be\\nthe same that had caught the eye of the pursued. Somewhere a man must\\nbegin, and it had better be just where another man might stop. Something\\nabout that flight of steps up to the shop, something about the quietude\\nand quaintness of the restaurant, roused all the detective’s rare\\nromantic fancy and made him resolve to strike at random. He went up the\\nsteps, and sitting down at a table by the window, asked for a cup of\\nblack coffee.\\n\\nIt was half-way through the morning, and he had not breakfasted; the\\nslight litter of other breakfasts stood about on the table to remind\\nhim of his hunger; and adding a poached egg to his order, he proceeded\\nmusingly to shake some white sugar into his coffee, thinking all the\\ntime about Flambeau. He remembered how Flambeau had escaped, once by a\\npair of nail scissors, and once by a house on fire; once by having to\\npay for an unstamped letter, and once by getting people to look through\\na telescope at a comet that might destroy the world. He thought his\\ndetective brain as good as the criminal’s, which was true. But he fully\\nrealised the disadvantage. “The criminal is the creative artist; the\\ndetective only the critic,” he said with a sour smile, and lifted his\\ncoffee cup to his lips slowly, and put it down very quickly. He had put\\nsalt in it.\\n\\nHe looked at the vessel from which the silvery powder had come; it\\nwas certainly a sugar-basin; as unmistakably meant for sugar as a\\nchampagne-bottle for champagne. He wondered why they should keep salt in\\nit. He looked to see if there were any more orthodox vessels. Yes; there\\nwere two salt-cellars quite full. Perhaps there was some speciality in\\nthe condiment in the salt-cellars. He tasted it; it was sugar. Then he\\nlooked round at the restaurant with a refreshed air of interest, to see\\nif there were any other traces of that singular artistic taste which\\nputs the sugar in the salt-cellars and the salt in the sugar-basin.\\nExcept for an odd splash of some dark fluid on one of the white-papered\\nwalls, the whole place appeared neat, cheerful and ordinary. He rang the\\nbell for the waiter.\\n\\nWhen that official hurried up, fuzzy-haired and somewhat blear-eyed at\\nthat early hour, the detective (who was not without an appreciation of\\nthe simpler forms of humour) asked him to taste the sugar and see if\\nit was up to the high reputation of the hotel. The result was that the\\nwaiter yawned suddenly and woke up.\\n\\n“Do you play this delicate joke on your customers every morning?”\\n inquired Valentin. “Does changing the salt and sugar never pall on you\\nas a jest?”\\n\\nThe waiter, when this irony grew clearer, stammeringly assured him that\\nthe establishment had certainly no such intention; it must be a most\\ncurious mistake. He picked up the sugar-basin and looked at it; he\\npicked up the salt-cellar and looked at that, his face growing more and\\nmore bewildered. At last he abruptly excused himself, and hurrying\\naway, returned in a few seconds with the proprietor. The proprietor also\\nexamined the sugar-basin and then the salt-cellar; the proprietor also\\nlooked bewildered.\\n\\nSuddenly the waiter seemed to grow inarticulate with a rush of words.\\n\\n“I zink,” he stuttered eagerly, “I zink it is those two clergy-men.”\\n\\n“What two clergymen?”\\n\\n“The two clergymen,” said the waiter, “that threw soup at the wall.”\\n\\n“Threw soup at the wall?” repeated Valentin, feeling sure this must be\\nsome singular Italian metaphor.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said the attendant excitedly, and pointed at the dark splash\\non the white paper; “threw it over there on the wall.”\\n\\nValentin looked his query at the proprietor, who came to his rescue with\\nfuller reports.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” he said, “it’s quite true, though I don’t suppose it has\\nanything to do with the sugar and salt. Two clergymen came in and drank\\nsoup here very early, as soon as the shutters were taken down. They were\\nboth very quiet, respectable people; one of them paid the bill and went\\nout; the other, who seemed a slower coach altogether, was some minutes\\nlonger getting his things together. But he went at last. Only, the\\ninstant before he stepped into the street he deliberately picked up\\nhis cup, which he had only half emptied, and threw the soup slap on the\\nwall. I was in the back room myself, and so was the waiter; so I could\\nonly rush out in time to find the wall splashed and the shop empty. It\\ndon’t do any particular damage, but it was confounded cheek; and I tried\\nto catch the men in the street. They were too far off though; I only\\nnoticed they went round the next corner into Carstairs Street.”\\n\\nThe detective was on his feet, hat settled and stick in hand. He had\\nalready decided that in the universal darkness of his mind he could\\nonly follow the first odd finger that pointed; and this finger was odd\\nenough. Paying his bill and clashing the glass doors behind him, he was\\nsoon swinging round into the other street.\\n\\nIt was fortunate that even in such fevered moments his eye was cool and\\nquick. Something in a shop-front went by him like a mere flash; yet\\nhe went back to look at it. The shop was a popular greengrocer and\\nfruiterer’s, an array of goods set out in the open air and plainly\\nticketed with their names and prices. In the two most prominent\\ncompartments were two heaps, of oranges and of nuts respectively. On\\nthe heap of nuts lay a scrap of cardboard, on which was written in bold,\\nblue chalk, “Best tangerine oranges, two a penny.” On the oranges was\\nthe equally clear and exact description, “Finest Brazil nuts, 4d. a lb.”\\n M. Valentin looked at these two placards and fancied he had met this\\nhighly subtle form of humour before, and that somewhat recently. He\\ndrew the attention of the red-faced fruiterer, who was looking\\nrather sullenly up and down the street, to this inaccuracy in his\\nadvertisements. The fruiterer said nothing, but sharply put each\\ncard into its proper place. The detective, leaning elegantly on his\\nwalking-cane, continued to scrutinise the shop. At last he said, “Pray\\nexcuse my apparent irrelevance, my good sir, but I should like to ask\\nyou a question in experimental psychology and the association of ideas.”\\n\\nThe red-faced shopman regarded him with an eye of menace; but he\\ncontinued gaily, swinging his cane, “Why,” he pursued, “why are two\\ntickets wrongly placed in a greengrocer’s shop like a shovel hat that\\nhas come to London for a holiday? Or, in case I do not make myself\\nclear, what is the mystical association which connects the idea of nuts\\nmarked as oranges with the idea of two clergymen, one tall and the other\\nshort?”\\n\\nThe eyes of the tradesman stood out of his head like a snail’s; he\\nreally seemed for an instant likely to fling himself upon the stranger.\\nAt last he stammered angrily: “I don’t know what you ’ave to do with it,\\nbut if you’re one of their friends, you can tell ’em from me that I’ll\\nknock their silly ’eads off, parsons or no parsons, if they upset my\\napples again.”\\n\\n“Indeed?” asked the detective, with great sympathy. “Did they upset your\\napples?”\\n\\n“One of ’em did,” said the heated shopman; “rolled ’em all over the\\nstreet. I’d ’ave caught the fool but for havin’ to pick ’em up.”\\n\\n“Which way did these parsons go?” asked Valentin.\\n\\n“Up that second road on the left-hand side, and then across the square,”\\n said the other promptly.\\n\\n“Thanks,” replied Valentin, and vanished like a fairy. On the other side\\nof the second square he found a policeman, and said: “This is urgent,\\nconstable; have you seen two clergymen in shovel hats?”\\n\\nThe policeman began to chuckle heavily. “I ’ave, sir; and if you arst\\nme, one of ’em was drunk. He stood in the middle of the road that\\nbewildered that--”\\n\\n“Which way did they go?” snapped Valentin.\\n\\n“They took one of them yellow buses over there,” answered the man; “them\\nthat go to Hampstead.”\\n\\nValentin produced his official card and said very rapidly: “Call up two\\nof your men to come with me in pursuit,” and crossed the road with such\\ncontagious energy that the ponderous policeman was moved to almost agile\\nobedience. In a minute and a half the French detective was joined on the\\nopposite pavement by an inspector and a man in plain clothes.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” began the former, with smiling importance, “and what\\nmay--?”\\n\\nValentin pointed suddenly with his cane. “I’ll tell you on the top of\\nthat omnibus,” he said, and was darting and dodging across the tangle of\\nthe traffic. When all three sank panting on the top seats of the yellow\\nvehicle, the inspector said: “We could go four times as quick in a\\ntaxi.”\\n\\n“Quite true,” replied their leader placidly, “if we only had an idea of\\nwhere we were going.”\\n\\n“Well, where are you going?” asked the other, staring.\\n\\nValentin smoked frowningly for a few seconds; then, removing his\\ncigarette, he said: “If you know what a man’s doing, get in front of\\nhim; but if you want to guess what he’s doing, keep behind him. Stray\\nwhen he strays; stop when he stops; travel as slowly as he. Then you may\\nsee what he saw and may act as he acted. All we can do is to keep our\\neyes skinned for a queer thing.”\\n\\n“What sort of queer thing do you mean?” asked the inspector.\\n\\n“Any sort of queer thing,” answered Valentin, and relapsed into\\nobstinate silence.\\n\\nThe yellow omnibus crawled up the northern roads for what seemed like\\nhours on end; the great detective would not explain further, and perhaps\\nhis assistants felt a silent and growing doubt of his errand. Perhaps,\\nalso, they felt a silent and growing desire for lunch, for the hours\\ncrept long past the normal luncheon hour, and the long roads of the\\nNorth London suburbs seemed to shoot out into length after length like\\nan infernal telescope. It was one of those journeys on which a man\\nperpetually feels that now at last he must have come to the end of the\\nuniverse, and then finds he has only come to the beginning of Tufnell\\nPark. London died away in draggled taverns and dreary scrubs, and then\\nwas unaccountably born again in blazing high streets and blatant hotels.\\nIt was like passing through thirteen separate vulgar cities all\\njust touching each other. But though the winter twilight was already\\nthreatening the road ahead of them, the Parisian detective still sat\\nsilent and watchful, eyeing the frontage of the streets that slid by on\\neither side. By the time they had left Camden Town behind, the policemen\\nwere nearly asleep; at least, they gave something like a jump as\\nValentin leapt erect, struck a hand on each man’s shoulder, and shouted\\nto the driver to stop.\\n\\nThey tumbled down the steps into the road without realising why they\\nhad been dislodged; when they looked round for enlightenment they found\\nValentin triumphantly pointing his finger towards a window on the left\\nside of the road. It was a large window, forming part of the long\\nfaçade of a gilt and palatial public-house; it was the part reserved for\\nrespectable dining, and labelled “Restaurant.” This window, like all the\\nrest along the frontage of the hotel, was of frosted and figured glass;\\nbut in the middle of it was a big, black smash, like a star in the ice.\\n\\n“Our cue at last,” cried Valentin, waving his stick; “the place with the\\nbroken window.”\\n\\n“What window? What cue?” asked his principal assistant. “Why, what proof\\nis there that this has anything to do with them?”\\n\\nValentin almost broke his bamboo stick with rage.\\n\\n“Proof!” he cried. “Good God! the man is looking for proof! Why, of\\ncourse, the chances are twenty to one that it has nothing to do with\\nthem. But what else can we do? Don’t you see we must either follow one\\nwild possibility or else go home to bed?” He banged his way into the\\nrestaurant, followed by his companions, and they were soon seated at a\\nlate luncheon at a little table, and looked at the star of smashed glass\\nfrom the inside. Not that it was very informative to them even then.\\n\\n“Got your window broken, I see,” said Valentin to the waiter as he paid\\nthe bill.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” answered the attendant, bending busily over the change, to\\nwhich Valentin silently added an enormous tip. The waiter straightened\\nhimself with mild but unmistakable animation.\\n\\n“Ah, yes, sir,” he said. “Very odd thing, that, sir.”\\n\\n“Indeed?” Tell us about it,” said the detective with careless curiosity.\\n\\n“Well, two gents in black came in,” said the waiter; “two of those\\nforeign parsons that are running about. They had a cheap and quiet\\nlittle lunch, and one of them paid for it and went out. The other was\\njust going out to join him when I looked at my change again and found\\nhe’d paid me more than three times too much. ‘Here,’ I says to the chap\\nwho was nearly out of the door, ‘you’ve paid too much.’ ‘Oh,’ he says,\\nvery cool, ‘have we?’ ‘Yes,’ I says, and picks up the bill to show him.\\nWell, that was a knock-out.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked his interlocutor.\\n\\n“Well, I’d have sworn on seven Bibles that I’d put 4s. on that bill. But\\nnow I saw I’d put 14s., as plain as paint.”\\n\\n“Well?” cried Valentin, moving slowly, but with burning eyes, “and\\nthen?”\\n\\n“The parson at the door he says all serene, ‘Sorry to confuse your\\naccounts, but it’ll pay for the window.’ ‘What window?’ I says. ‘The\\none I’m going to break,’ he says, and smashed that blessed pane with his\\numbrella.”\\n\\nAll three inquirers made an exclamation; and the inspector said under\\nhis breath, “Are we after escaped lunatics?” The waiter went on with\\nsome relish for the ridiculous story:\\n\\n“I was so knocked silly for a second, I couldn’t do anything. The man\\nmarched out of the place and joined his friend just round the corner.\\nThen they went so quick up Bullock Street that I couldn’t catch them,\\nthough I ran round the bars to do it.”\\n\\n“Bullock Street,” said the detective, and shot up that thoroughfare as\\nquickly as the strange couple he pursued.\\n\\nTheir journey now took them through bare brick ways like tunnels;\\nstreets with few lights and even with few windows; streets that seemed\\nbuilt out of the blank backs of everything and everywhere. Dusk was\\ndeepening, and it was not easy even for the London policemen to guess\\nin what exact direction they were treading. The inspector, however, was\\npretty certain that they would eventually strike some part of Hampstead\\nHeath. Abruptly one bulging gas-lit window broke the blue twilight like\\na bull’s-eye lantern; and Valentin stopped an instant before a little\\ngarish sweetstuff shop. After an instant’s hesitation he went in; he\\nstood amid the gaudy colours of the confectionery with entire gravity\\nand bought thirteen chocolate cigars with a certain care. He was clearly\\npreparing an opening; but he did not need one.\\n\\nAn angular, elderly young woman in the shop had regarded his elegant\\nappearance with a merely automatic inquiry; but when she saw the door\\nbehind him blocked with the blue uniform of the inspector, her eyes\\nseemed to wake up.\\n\\n“Oh,” she said, “if you’ve come about that parcel, I’ve sent it off\\nalready.”\\n\\n“Parcel?” repeated Valentin; and it was his turn to look inquiring.\\n\\n“I mean the parcel the gentleman left--the clergyman gentleman.”\\n\\n“For goodness’ sake,” said Valentin, leaning forward with his first\\nreal confession of eagerness, “for Heaven’s sake tell us what happened\\nexactly.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the woman a little doubtfully, “the clergymen came in about\\nhalf an hour ago and bought some peppermints and talked a bit, and then\\nwent off towards the Heath. But a second after, one of them runs\\nback into the shop and says, ‘Have I left a parcel!’ Well, I looked\\neverywhere and couldn’t see one; so he says, ‘Never mind; but if it\\nshould turn up, please post it to this address,’ and he left me the\\naddress and a shilling for my trouble. And sure enough, though I thought\\nI’d looked everywhere, I found he’d left a brown paper parcel, so I\\nposted it to the place he said. I can’t remember the address now; it\\nwas somewhere in Westminster. But as the thing seemed so important, I\\nthought perhaps the police had come about it.”\\n\\n“So they have,” said Valentin shortly. “Is Hampstead Heath near here?”\\n\\n“Straight on for fifteen minutes,” said the woman, “and you’ll come\\nright out on the open.” Valentin sprang out of the shop and began to\\nrun. The other detectives followed him at a reluctant trot.\\n\\nThe street they threaded was so narrow and shut in by shadows that when\\nthey came out unexpectedly into the void common and vast sky they were\\nstartled to find the evening still so light and clear. A perfect dome\\nof peacock-green sank into gold amid the blackening trees and the dark\\nviolet distances. The glowing green tint was just deep enough to pick\\nout in points of crystal one or two stars. All that was left of the\\ndaylight lay in a golden glitter across the edge of Hampstead and that\\npopular hollow which is called the Vale of Health. The holiday makers\\nwho roam this region had not wholly dispersed; a few couples sat\\nshapelessly on benches; and here and there a distant girl still shrieked\\nin one of the swings. The glory of heaven deepened and darkened around\\nthe sublime vulgarity of man; and standing on the slope and looking\\nacross the valley, Valentin beheld the thing which he sought.\\n\\nAmong the black and breaking groups in that distance was one especially\\nblack which did not break--a group of two figures clerically clad.\\nThough they seemed as small as insects, Valentin could see that one of\\nthem was much smaller than the other. Though the other had a student’s\\nstoop and an inconspicuous manner, he could see that the man was well\\nover six feet high. He shut his teeth and went forward, whirling his\\nstick impatiently. By the time he had substantially diminished the\\ndistance and magnified the two black figures as in a vast microscope,\\nhe had perceived something else; something which startled him, and yet\\nwhich he had somehow expected. Whoever was the tall priest, there could\\nbe no doubt about the identity of the short one. It was his friend of\\nthe Harwich train, the stumpy little cure of Essex whom he had warned\\nabout his brown paper parcels.\\n\\nNow, so far as this went, everything fitted in finally and rationally\\nenough. Valentin had learned by his inquiries that morning that a Father\\nBrown from Essex was bringing up a silver cross with sapphires, a\\nrelic of considerable value, to show some of the foreign priests at the\\ncongress. This undoubtedly was the “silver with blue stones”; and Father\\nBrown undoubtedly was the little greenhorn in the train. Now there\\nwas nothing wonderful about the fact that what Valentin had found out\\nFlambeau had also found out; Flambeau found out everything. Also there\\nwas nothing wonderful in the fact that when Flambeau heard of a sapphire\\ncross he should try to steal it; that was the most natural thing in all\\nnatural history. And most certainly there was nothing wonderful about\\nthe fact that Flambeau should have it all his own way with such a silly\\nsheep as the man with the umbrella and the parcels. He was the sort of\\nman whom anybody could lead on a string to the North Pole; it was not\\nsurprising that an actor like Flambeau, dressed as another priest, could\\nlead him to Hampstead Heath. So far the crime seemed clear enough; and\\nwhile the detective pitied the priest for his helplessness, he almost\\ndespised Flambeau for condescending to so gullible a victim. But when\\nValentin thought of all that had happened in between, of all that had\\nled him to his triumph, he racked his brains for the smallest rhyme or\\nreason in it. What had the stealing of a blue-and-silver cross from a\\npriest from Essex to do with chucking soup at wall paper? What had it\\nto do with calling nuts oranges, or with paying for windows first and\\nbreaking them afterwards? He had come to the end of his chase; yet\\nsomehow he had missed the middle of it. When he failed (which was\\nseldom), he had usually grasped the clue, but nevertheless missed the\\ncriminal. Here he had grasped the criminal, but still he could not grasp\\nthe clue.\\n\\nThe two figures that they followed were crawling like black flies\\nacross the huge green contour of a hill. They were evidently sunk in\\nconversation, and perhaps did not notice where they were going; but they\\nwere certainly going to the wilder and more silent heights of the Heath.\\nAs their pursuers gained on them, the latter had to use the undignified\\nattitudes of the deer-stalker, to crouch behind clumps of trees and\\neven to crawl prostrate in deep grass. By these ungainly ingenuities the\\nhunters even came close enough to the quarry to hear the murmur of the\\ndiscussion, but no word could be distinguished except the word “reason”\\n recurring frequently in a high and almost childish voice. Once over\\nan abrupt dip of land and a dense tangle of thickets, the detectives\\nactually lost the two figures they were following. They did not find the\\ntrail again for an agonising ten minutes, and then it led round the brow\\nof a great dome of hill overlooking an amphitheatre of rich and desolate\\nsunset scenery. Under a tree in this commanding yet neglected spot was\\nan old ramshackle wooden seat. On this seat sat the two priests still in\\nserious speech together. The gorgeous green and gold still clung to\\nthe darkening horizon; but the dome above was turning slowly from\\npeacock-green to peacock-blue, and the stars detached themselves more\\nand more like solid jewels. Mutely motioning to his followers, Valentin\\ncontrived to creep up behind the big branching tree, and, standing there\\nin deathly silence, heard the words of the strange priests for the first\\ntime.\\n\\nAfter he had listened for a minute and a half, he was gripped by a\\ndevilish doubt. Perhaps he had dragged the two English policemen to the\\nwastes of a nocturnal heath on an errand no saner than seeking figs on\\nits thistles. For the two priests were talking exactly like priests,\\npiously, with learning and leisure, about the most aerial enigmas of\\ntheology. The little Essex priest spoke the more simply, with his round\\nface turned to the strengthening stars; the other talked with his\\nhead bowed, as if he were not even worthy to look at them. But no more\\ninnocently clerical conversation could have been heard in any white\\nItalian cloister or black Spanish cathedral.\\n\\nThe first he heard was the tail of one of Father Brown’s sentences,\\nwhich ended: “... what they really meant in the Middle Ages by the\\nheavens being incorruptible.”\\n\\nThe taller priest nodded his bowed head and said:\\n\\n“Ah, yes, these modern infidels appeal to their reason; but who can\\nlook at those millions of worlds and not feel that there may well be\\nwonderful universes above us where reason is utterly unreasonable?”\\n\\n“No,” said the other priest; “reason is always reasonable, even in the\\nlast limbo, in the lost borderland of things. I know that people charge\\nthe Church with lowering reason, but it is just the other way. Alone\\non earth, the Church makes reason really supreme. Alone on earth, the\\nChurch affirms that God himself is bound by reason.”\\n\\nThe other priest raised his austere face to the spangled sky and said:\\n\\n“Yet who knows if in that infinite universe--?”\\n\\n“Only infinite physically,” said the little priest, turning sharply\\nin his seat, “not infinite in the sense of escaping from the laws of\\ntruth.”\\n\\nValentin behind his tree was tearing his fingernails with silent fury.\\nHe seemed almost to hear the sniggers of the English detectives whom\\nhe had brought so far on a fantastic guess only to listen to the\\nmetaphysical gossip of two mild old parsons. In his impatience he lost\\nthe equally elaborate answer of the tall cleric, and when he listened\\nagain it was again Father Brown who was speaking:\\n\\n“Reason and justice grip the remotest and the loneliest star. Look\\nat those stars. Don’t they look as if they were single diamonds and\\nsapphires? Well, you can imagine any mad botany or geology you please.\\nThink of forests of adamant with leaves of brilliants. Think the moon\\nis a blue moon, a single elephantine sapphire. But don’t fancy that all\\nthat frantic astronomy would make the smallest difference to the reason\\nand justice of conduct. On plains of opal, under cliffs cut out of\\npearl, you would still find a notice-board, ‘Thou shalt not steal.’”\\n\\nValentin was just in the act of rising from his rigid and crouching\\nattitude and creeping away as softly as might be, felled by the one\\ngreat folly of his life. But something in the very silence of the tall\\npriest made him stop until the latter spoke. When at last he did speak,\\nhe said simply, his head bowed and his hands on his knees:\\n\\n“Well, I think that other worlds may perhaps rise higher than our\\nreason. The mystery of heaven is unfathomable, and I for one can only\\nbow my head.”\\n\\nThen, with brow yet bent and without changing by the faintest shade his\\nattitude or voice, he added:\\n\\n“Just hand over that sapphire cross of yours, will you? We’re all alone\\nhere, and I could pull you to pieces like a straw doll.”\\n\\nThe utterly unaltered voice and attitude added a strange violence to\\nthat shocking change of speech. But the guarder of the relic only seemed\\nto turn his head by the smallest section of the compass. He seemed still\\nto have a somewhat foolish face turned to the stars. Perhaps he had not\\nunderstood. Or, perhaps, he had understood and sat rigid with terror.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the tall priest, in the same low voice and in the same still\\nposture, “yes, I am Flambeau.”\\n\\nThen, after a pause, he said:\\n\\n“Come, will you give me that cross?”\\n\\n“No,” said the other, and the monosyllable had an odd sound.\\n\\nFlambeau suddenly flung off all his pontifical pretensions. The great\\nrobber leaned back in his seat and laughed low but long.\\n\\n“No,” he cried, “you won’t give it me, you proud prelate. You won’t give\\nit me, you little celibate simpleton. Shall I tell you why you won’t\\ngive it me? Because I’ve got it already in my own breast-pocket.”\\n\\nThe small man from Essex turned what seemed to be a dazed face in the\\ndusk, and said, with the timid eagerness of “The Private Secretary”:\\n\\n“Are--are you sure?”\\n\\nFlambeau yelled with delight.\\n\\n“Really, you’re as good as a three-act farce,” he cried. “Yes, you\\nturnip, I am quite sure. I had the sense to make a duplicate of the\\nright parcel, and now, my friend, you’ve got the duplicate and I’ve got\\nthe jewels. An old dodge, Father Brown--a very old dodge.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Father Brown, and passed his hand through his hair with the\\nsame strange vagueness of manner. “Yes, I’ve heard of it before.”\\n\\nThe colossus of crime leaned over to the little rustic priest with a\\nsort of sudden interest.\\n\\n“You have heard of it?” he asked. “Where have you heard of it?”\\n\\n“Well, I mustn’t tell you his name, of course,” said the little man\\nsimply. “He was a penitent, you know. He had lived prosperously for\\nabout twenty years entirely on duplicate brown paper parcels. And so,\\nyou see, when I began to suspect you, I thought of this poor chap’s way\\nof doing it at once.”\\n\\n“Began to suspect me?” repeated the outlaw with increased intensity.\\n“Did you really have the gumption to suspect me just because I brought\\nyou up to this bare part of the heath?”\\n\\n“No, no,” said Brown with an air of apology. “You see, I suspected you\\nwhen we first met. It’s that little bulge up the sleeve where you people\\nhave the spiked bracelet.”\\n\\n“How in Tartarus,” cried Flambeau, “did you ever hear of the spiked\\nbracelet?”\\n\\n“Oh, one’s little flock, you know!” said Father Brown, arching his\\neyebrows rather blankly. “When I was a curate in Hartlepool, there were\\nthree of them with spiked bracelets. So, as I suspected you from the\\nfirst, don’t you see, I made sure that the cross should go safe, anyhow.\\nI’m afraid I watched you, you know. So at last I saw you change the\\nparcels. Then, don’t you see, I changed them back again. And then I left\\nthe right one behind.”\\n\\n“Left it behind?” repeated Flambeau, and for the first time there was\\nanother note in his voice beside his triumph.\\n\\n“Well, it was like this,” said the little priest, speaking in the same\\nunaffected way. “I went back to that sweet-shop and asked if I’d left a\\nparcel, and gave them a particular address if it turned up. Well, I knew\\nI hadn’t; but when I went away again I did. So, instead of running after\\nme with that valuable parcel, they have sent it flying to a friend of\\nmine in Westminster.” Then he added rather sadly: “I learnt that, too,\\nfrom a poor fellow in Hartlepool. He used to do it with handbags he\\nstole at railway stations, but he’s in a monastery now. Oh, one gets to\\nknow, you know,” he added, rubbing his head again with the same sort of\\ndesperate apology. “We can’t help being priests. People come and tell us\\nthese things.”\\n\\nFlambeau tore a brown-paper parcel out of his inner pocket and rent it\\nin pieces. There was nothing but paper and sticks of lead inside it. He\\nsprang to his feet with a gigantic gesture, and cried:\\n\\n“I don’t believe you. I don’t believe a bumpkin like you could manage\\nall that. I believe you’ve still got the stuff on you, and if you don’t\\ngive it up--why, we’re all alone, and I’ll take it by force!”\\n\\n“No,” said Father Brown simply, and stood up also, “you won’t take it\\nby force. First, because I really haven’t still got it. And, second,\\nbecause we are not alone.”\\n\\nFlambeau stopped in his stride forward.\\n\\n“Behind that tree,” said Father Brown, pointing, “are two strong\\npolicemen and the greatest detective alive. How did they come here, do\\nyou ask? Why, I brought them, of course! How did I do it? Why, I’ll tell\\nyou if you like! Lord bless you, we have to know twenty such things\\nwhen we work among the criminal classes! Well, I wasn’t sure you were\\na thief, and it would never do to make a scandal against one of our\\nown clergy. So I just tested you to see if anything would make you show\\nyourself. A man generally makes a small scene if he finds salt in his\\ncoffee; if he doesn’t, he has some reason for keeping quiet. I changed\\nthe salt and sugar, and you kept quiet. A man generally objects if\\nhis bill is three times too big. If he pays it, he has some motive for\\npassing unnoticed. I altered your bill, and you paid it.”\\n\\nThe world seemed waiting for Flambeau to leap like a tiger. But he was\\nheld back as by a spell; he was stunned with the utmost curiosity.\\n\\n“Well,” went on Father Brown, with lumbering lucidity, “as you wouldn’t\\nleave any tracks for the police, of course somebody had to. At every\\nplace we went to, I took care to do something that would get us talked\\nabout for the rest of the day. I didn’t do much harm--a splashed wall,\\nspilt apples, a broken window; but I saved the cross, as the cross will\\nalways be saved. It is at Westminster by now. I rather wonder you didn’t\\nstop it with the Donkey’s Whistle.”\\n\\n“With the what?” asked Flambeau.\\n\\n“I’m glad you’ve never heard of it,” said the priest, making a face.\\n“It’s a foul thing. I’m sure you’re too good a man for a Whistler. I\\ncouldn’t have countered it even with the Spots myself; I’m not strong\\nenough in the legs.”\\n\\n“What on earth are you talking about?” asked the other.\\n\\n“Well, I did think you’d know the Spots,” said Father Brown, agreeably\\nsurprised. “Oh, you can’t have gone so very wrong yet!”\\n\\n“How in blazes do you know all these horrors?” cried Flambeau.\\n\\nThe shadow of a smile crossed the round, simple face of his clerical\\nopponent.\\n\\n“Oh, by being a celibate simpleton, I suppose,” he said. “Has it never\\nstruck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men’s real sins\\nis not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil? But, as a matter of\\nfact, another part of my trade, too, made me sure you weren’t a priest.”\\n\\n“What?” asked the thief, almost gaping.\\n\\n“You attacked reason,” said Father Brown. “It’s bad theology.”\\n\\nAnd even as he turned away to collect his property, the three policemen\\ncame out from under the twilight trees. Flambeau was an artist and a\\nsportsman. He stepped back and swept Valentin a great bow.\\n\\n“Do not bow to me, mon ami,” said Valentin with silver clearness. “Let\\nus both bow to our master.”\\n\\nAnd they both stood an instant uncovered while the little Essex priest\\nblinked about for his umbrella.\\n\\n    </story>\\n    <question>\\n    Who is the main antagonist in the story and what motivates their actions?\\n    </question>\\n', actual_output=\"The main antagonist in the story is Flambeau, a notorious criminal known for his ingenious and bold crimes.
